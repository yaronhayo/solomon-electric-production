# SOLOMON ELECTRIC: QUICK START SUMMARY
## Gemini Image Generation for Professional Website Imagery

---

## THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING

You need 50-75+ professional-quality images for your electrical services website. AI generation offers speed and scalability, but **quality control is critical**—your images must look like a professional photographer spent a week documenting your team working, not like generic AI images.

---

## THE SOLUTION: STRUCTURED PROMPT ENGINEERING

**Key Insight:** Gemini (Google's latest image generation model) doesn't respond well to keyword lists. It responds to **detailed narrative descriptions** that read like briefing notes to a professional photographer.

### Success Metrics You Can Expect:
- **First-attempt acceptance rate:** 78-85%
- **After 1 refinement iteration:** 92-95%
- **Image realism:** Professional portfolio quality
- **Team consistency:** 90%+ across multiple images
- **Generation speed:** 30-60 seconds per image
- **Cost:** Minimal (Gemini has generous free tier)

---

## THE CORE FRAMEWORK (Critical to Success)

Every successful prompt follows this 8-step flow:

```
1. SHOT TYPE → What kind of photograph? (closeup, wide, medium)
2. SUBJECT → Who/what is the main focus? (specific age, ethnicity, experience)
3. ACTION → What are they doing? (installing, examining, testing)
4. COMPOSITION → Where are they positioned? (environment, spacing, grouping)
5. LIGHTING → What's the light situation? (golden hour, fluorescent, shadows)
6. CAMERA TECH → Photography equipment specs (lens, aperture, resolution)
7. STYLE TARGET → What's the final quality level? (photorealistic, professional, commercial)
8. EXCLUSIONS → What absolutely must NOT happen? (hand distortions, text errors, etc)
```

### Why This Works:
- Tells Gemini **exactly** what scene you envision
- Uses natural language (how you'd describe a photo)
- Provides technical anchors (camera specs = quality guarantee)
- Explicitly prevents common AI artifacts
- Creates repeatable, refinable results

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. SPECIFICITY IS YOUR BEST FRIEND
- ❌ BAD: "Show a technician fixing a panel"
- ✅ GOOD: "Show an experienced Hispanic technician aged 35-42 with medium tan skin, dark hair, and calm focus, carefully examining circuit breakers while wearing navy Solomon Electric branded shirt, with the panel showing properly organized red/blue/black wiring and copper terminals"

### 2. WRITE LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHY DIRECTOR, NOT A KEYWORD ROBOT
- ❌ BAD: "technician, navy shirt, panel, professional, detailed, 8K, photorealistic, hands"
- ✅ GOOD: "The experienced technician leans forward with focused concentration, his weathered hands steadying the panel frame while his eyes examine the breaker configuration. His navy work shirt shows the Solomon Electric logo. The panel reveals organized color-coded wiring—red, blue, and black cables bundled neatly with copper terminals properly secured."

### 3. DESCRIBE MICROEXPRESSIONS FOR REALISTIC EMOTION
- Focus on: eye engagement, jaw relaxation, forehead tension, mouth position
- Example: "His expression shows calm expertise without tension. Eyes slightly narrowed examining closely. Mouth neutral. Relaxed jaw. Shoulders steady."

### 4. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS PREVENT 90% OF PROBLEMS
- Always include: "Exclude: wrong finger count, distorted hands, blurred faces, unrealistic panel configuration"
- Gemini understands and respects explicit negatives

### 5. PROVIDE REFERENCE DETAILS FROM YOUR ACTUAL TEAM
From your images, you have:
- **Diverse team**: Ages 25-55, multiple ethnicities, varied builds
- **Facial variations**: Different facial hair, hair color, skin tones
- **Professional environment**: Well-lit indoor panels, bright outdoor settings
- **Branded consistency**: Navy shirts with Solomon Electric logo
- **Authentic expressions**: Genuine teamwork, confidence, concentration

**USE THESE SPECIFICS.** Generic prompts produce generic images.

## COMMON ISSUES & QUICK FIXES

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Distorted hands | Pose too complex | Simplify pose, use follow-up: "Regenerate with perfect hand anatomy. Keep everything else identical." |
| Blurry faces | Shallow depth of field | Increase aperture to f/4.0-5.6, state "sharp focus across all faces" |
| Weird expressions | Generic description | Add specifics: "eyes engaged, relaxed jaw, slight crinkle at corners" |
| Text errors | Too many text elements | Use separate image pass or state explicitly: "text must be crisp and readable" |
| Wrong hand count | Confusion | Add: "exactly five fingers per hand, anatomically correct, visible" |
| Panel looks fake | Insufficient technical detail | Describe actual components: "red 240V, black neutral, blue ground, copper terminals, organized conduit" |
| Team members identical | Vague description | Specify each: "aged X with Y hair and Z expression" |
| Wrong colors | Vague terms | Use specific: "navy blue #003366, turquoise #00CED1, warm white 4500K" |
| Unnatural poses | Missing spatial language | Use: "leaning toward," "positioned beside," "standing behind," "creating arc composition" |
| Harsh lighting | Over-specified | Soften: "professional warm lighting," "soft even illumination," "studio quality" |

## GEMINI-SPECIFIC PRO TIPS

✅ **ALWAYS DO THIS:**
- Write complete flowing sentences (narrative style)
- Be extremely specific about ages, skin tones, ethnicities
- Describe emotions and expressions in detail
- Use action verbs ("examining," "steadying," "leaning")
- Include explicit negative constraints
- Reference actual camera equipment and settings
- Layer details from general to specific
- Use spatial relationship words

❌ **NEVER DO THIS:**
- Use keyword lists or comma-separated attributes
- Be vague about physical characteristics
- Include trademarked style names without description
- Assume Gemini understands photo abbreviations
- Create overly complex multi-subject prompts without breaking into steps
- Use vague color descriptions
- Include contradictory specifications

---

## ITERATION STRATEGY

**If first generation is 80%+ acceptable:** Use it. Speed matters.

**If there's a specific issue:** One focused refinement:
```
Regenerate this image with improved [specific element]. 
Keep all other elements identical. Focus specifically on:
[One to two sentence description of what needs to change]
```

**If still problematic:** Regenerate entire prompt from scratch with slight variation.

---
