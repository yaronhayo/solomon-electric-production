## PART 1: GEMINI-OPTIMIZED PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

### The Core Structure (Proven Framework)

Gemini responds best to **narrative-style, naturally written descriptions** rather than keyword lists. The optimal structure follows this modular pattern:

```
[SHOT TYPE & ENVIRONMENT] → [SUBJECT INTRODUCTION] → [ACTION/DETAIL] → 
[COMPOSITION & POSITIONING] → [LIGHTING SPECIFICATION] → [CAMERA TECH] → 
[STYLE/REALISM TARGET] → [EXCLUSIONS/CONSTRAINTS]
```

**Why this structure works for Gemini:**
1. **Narrative flow**: Reads like you're describing a photograph to someone
2. **Spatial clarity**: Establishes environment before placing subjects
3. **Explicit negatives**: Prevents common artifacts (wrong hand count, distorted text)
4. **Technical grounding**: Camera specs anchor the realism level

## PART 7: GEMINI-SPECIFIC BEST PRACTICES

### What Works Best with Gemini Flash:

✅ **DO:**
- Write in complete, flowing sentences (narrative style)
- Be specific about ages, skin tones, ethnic backgrounds
- Describe emotions and expressions in detail
- Use action verbs to activate physics understanding
- Include explicit negative constraints
- Reference professional camera and lens terminology
- Layer details from general to specific
- Use natural spatial relationship words ("beside," "leaning toward," "positioned behind")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use keyword lists or comma-separated attributes
- Be vague about physical characteristics ("person," "technician" without detail)
- Include trademarked style names without descriptive alternatives
- Assume Gemini understands abbreviated photo terminology
- Create overly complex multi-subject prompts without breaking into steps
- Use ambiguous color descriptions ("dark," "light")
- Include contradictory specifications

### Multi-Turn Iterative Strategy:

**Turn 1 (Generation):** Full detailed base prompt
**Turn 2 (If needed):** Single-focused refinement on problem area
**Turn 3 (If needed):** Integration of refined element back into full composition

Composition emphasizes vehicle presence and brand visibility: straight-on angle showing full 
vehicle side and rear branding, positioning in frame shows roughly 2/3 of frame dedicated to 
vehicle with appropriate negative space showing job site context. The image communicates: 
"This is a professional, established, trustworthy electrical service company with proper 
licensing and insurance."

Exclude: distorted text rendering, illegible lettering, faded or discolored paint, dirty or 
poorly maintained appearance, peeling decals, incorrect logo colors, shadowed branding areas 
making text unreadable, unrealistic job site setting.
```

**When to use:** Service pages, "About Us" section, portfolio gallery, trust-building sections
**Expected quality:** 85-92% on first generation
**Common issue:** Text rendering may require refinement iteration

## PART 10: FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Scaling to Full Website (50-75 images):

1. **Prioritize core sections first:**
   - Homepage hero (2-3 images)
   - Services overview (6-8 images)
   - Team/About (4-6 images)

2. **Generate in batches by category:**
   - Generate all homepage images together for consistency
   - Move to service category, ensuring lighting/style consistency
   - Team images next, establishing character consistency

3. **Quality assurance process:**
   - First generation: Accept if 85%+ quality
   - Issues found: One refinement iteration maximum
   - If still problematic: Regenerate from base prompt with variation

4. **Timeline estimate:**
   - Simple prompts (single subject): 30-45 seconds per image
   - Complex prompts (multiple subjects): 60-90 seconds per image
   - Refinement iterations: 30-45 seconds additional
   - Total for 60-image set: Approximately 8-12 hours generation time

### Long-term Maintenance:

- Keep prompt library updated with successful versions
- Document any model behavior changes
- Create seasonal variations (holiday, seasonal service focus)
- Maintain character consistency across new scenario generations
- Archive before/after refinement examples for team training

## APPENDIX: TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Distorted hands | Complex pose or busy frame | Simplify pose, use follow-up refine prompt, increase aperture value to f/2.8 |
| Blurry faces in group | Shallow depth of field / wide composition | Increase aperture f-number (f/4.0-5.6), specify "sharp focus across all faces" |
| Unnatural expressions | Generic expression description | Add specific microexpression details (crinkled eyes, relaxed jaw, specific brow position) |
| Text rendering errors | Too many text elements in one prompt | Separate text generation into dedicated follow-up or split into two images |
| Wrong hand count | Physics confusion | Add explicit constraint: "exactly five fingers on each hand, visible and anatomically correct" |
| Distorted electrical components | Insufficient technical detail | Add specific component descriptions: "copper terminals," "organized wire bundles," "labeled breaker positions" |
| Inconsistent team member faces | Insufficient individual description | Increase specificity on each person: "aged X-Y with Z facial features, A expression, B hair style" |
| Color inaccuracy | Vague color terms | Use specific color terms: "navy blue #003366," "turquoise #00CED1," "warm white 4500K" |
| Unrealistic proportions | Missing spatial relationships | Add explicit spatial language: "positioned behind," "leaning toward," "arranged in arc," "depth variation" |
| Harsh, unflattering lighting | Over-specified dramatic lighting | Soften description: "professional warm lighting," "soft even illumination," "studio quality" |
