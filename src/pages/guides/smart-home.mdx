### Hurricane Preparedness
Smart switches maintain settings after power outages—lights return to previous state when power restores.

### Energy Costs
South Florida's high cooling costs make smart thermostats especially valuable—ROI in 1-2 years.

### Outdoor Equipment
Outdoor smart devices need proper weather protection—we use weather-resistant boxes and sealing.

### Future Integration
Plan for expansion—leave extra circuits and conduit for adding smart devices later.
