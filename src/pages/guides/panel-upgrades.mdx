## Common Panel Upgrade Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Installing an EV Charger

**Challenge**: Your 100amp panel doesn't have capacity for a Level 2 EV charger (requires 40-50 amps).

**Solution**: Upgrade to 200-amp service provides capacity for EV charger plus all existing loads.

**Related**: [Level 2 EV Charger Installation](/services/level-2-ev-charger-installation) | [Tesla & Universal EV Charging Guide](/blog/tesla-universal-ev-charging-station-installation)

### Scenario 2: Federal Pacific Panel

**Challenge**: Your panel is labeled "FPE" or "Federal Pacific"—a documented fire hazard.

**Solution**: Immediate replacement regardless of age. These panels have breakers that fail to trip.

**Related**: [Panel Modernization Guide](/blog/electrical-panel-modernization-upgrades)

### Scenario 3: Frequently Tripping Breakers

**Challenge**: Breakers trip when running AC and other appliances simultaneously.

**Solution**: Load calculation determines if you need more capacity (panel upgrade) or circuit redistribution (panel repair).

**Related**: [Panel Repair Guide](/blog/electrical-panel-repair) | [Electrical Diagnostics](/blog/expert-electrical-diagnostics-repair)

### Scenario 4: Home Renovation/Addition

**Challenge**: Adding square footage, kitchen upgrade, or pool installation requires more electrical capacity.

**Solution**: Load assessment determines if existing panel can support additions or needs upgrade.
