  "question": "Why are Federal Pacific and Zinsco panels considered dangerous?",
  "answer": "These panel brands, common in Broward and Miami-Dade homes built between 1950 and 1980, have a documented history of failing to 'trip' during an overload. When a breaker stays on instead of cutting power, the wires can heat up to several thousand degrees, leading to an electrical fire behind your walls. Most 4-point inspectors will flag these panels for immediate replacement.",
