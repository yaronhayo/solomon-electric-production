  "question": "What is a 4-Point Inspection and why does my insurance require a panel upgrade?",
  "answer": "A 4-Point Inspection evaluates your home's HVAC, plumbing, roof, and electrical systems. Florida insurance carriers (like Citizens) often require electrical upgrades if your panel is over 30 years old, uses cloth wiring, or is a hazardous brand like Federal Pacific or Zinsco. Solomon Electric provides the certified documentation and upgrades needed to satisfy these insurance requirements and maintain your coverage.",
