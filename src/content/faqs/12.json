  "question": "Does whole-home surge protection really work against Florida lightning?",
  "answer": "While no device can stop a direct hit from a million-volt bolt, whole-home surge protection is highly effective against 'induced surges'—the 30,000-amp spikes that travel through power lines when lightning strikes nearby. These events happen thousands of times a year in South Florida and are the #1 cause of fried AC control boards and smart appliances. Modern protection at the panel diverts this energy safely into the ground.",
