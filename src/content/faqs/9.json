  "question": "How does South Florida's salt air affect my electrical system?",
  "answer": "If you live near the coast in Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, or Aventura, salt air accelerates the corrosion of your outdoor service mast, meter base, and even the internal connections of your main panel. This can lead to overheating and 'arcing' fires. We recommend a maritime-specific electrical inspection every 2-3 years for coastal properties to ensure your primary service lines remain safe.",
