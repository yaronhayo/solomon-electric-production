  "question": "What parts of my electrical system am I responsible for versus FPL?",
  "answer": "Florida Power & Light (FPL) is typically responsible for the wires coming FROM the pole TO your house. The homeowner is responsible for everything attached to the house, including the service mast (the pipe), the weatherhead, the meter enclosure, and the main electrical panel. If these structural components are damaged during a storm, you must hire a licensed electrician to repair them before FPL will restore your power.",
