faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between motion sensor lights and occupancy sensors?"
    answer: "Motion sensors detect movement and turn lights on automatically—common for outdoor security. Occupancy sensors are more sensitive, designed for indoor use (bathrooms, closets), and often include vacancy mode (manual on, automatic off). Both save energy but occupancy sensors are better for interior spaces where you want reliability without false triggers."
  - question: "How do you prevent outdoor motion lights from triggering constantly?"
    answer: "We adjust sensitivity settings, aim sensors away from moving trees/traffic, set appropriate detection zones, and use dual-technology sensors (PIR + microwave) that reduce false triggers. Proper positioning is key—mounting height, angle, and avoiding direct sun exposure all affect performance. We test and adjust during installation."
  - question: "Can smart security lights integrate with my alarm system?"
    answer: "Yes. Many smart lighting systems integrate with alarm systems,smart home hubs (Alexa, Google Home, HomeKit), and security cameras. We install systems like Ring Smart Lighting, Lutron Caséta, or hardwired solutions that trigger lights when alarms activate, creating comprehensive security automation."
  - question: "What's the best lighting for deterring burglars in Miami?"
    answer: "Motion-activated flood lights at all entry points (doors, windows, garage), pathway lighting eliminating dark approach areas, and smart lights on timers creating occupied appearance when away. Studies show well-lit homes are significantly less likely to be targeted. We design layered security lighting that's both effective and energy-efficient."
  - question: "Do motion sensor lights work during power outages?"
    answer: "Standard motion lights don't work during outages. However, we can install battery-backup systems or integrate with whole-home generators to maintain security lighting during storms—critical in hurricane-prone South Florida where power outages can last days."
  - question: "How long do motion sensor lights stay on?"
    answer: "Adjustable from 30 seconds to 30 minutes depending on model and settings. We typically set outdoor security lights for 3-5 minutes, bathroom occupancy sensors for 5-10 minutes, and closet sensors for 2-3 minutes. You can adjust timing based on your preferences and usage patterns."

# Light Up. Automatically. Intelligently.

You pull into your driveway at night. Before you even open the car door, your pathway lights illuminate, garage floods on, and entry lights welcome you home.

You're not flipping switches. You're not fumbling in the dark. **Smart lighting does it automatically.**

Modern security and sensor lighting protects your home, saves energy, and adds convenience. Here's how to design and install intelligent lighting systems for South Florida homes.

- **Safety**: Illuminate pathways, steps, entries automatically

Motion sensors pay for themselves through energy savings in 1-2 years.

### Where should I install motion sensor lights?

**Essential locations**:
- Front entry/porch
- Garage door and driveway
- Side gates and walkways
- Backyard access points
- Pool deck entrances
- Trash/utility areas

**Interior locations**:
- Bathrooms (occupancy sensors)
- Closets and pantries
- Laundry rooms
- Garages (interior sensors)
- Stairways

### Do smart lights need special wiring?

**Depends on the system**:
- **Smart bulbs**: Use existing wiring, control via phone
- **Smart switches**: Replace standard switches, require neutral wire
- **Hardwired sensors**: Professional installation, proper circuit wiring

We install all types and recommend solutions based on your needs.

## Security Lighting Design Principles

### Layered Lighting Approach

**Layer 1: Perimeter Lighting**
- Illuminate property boundaries
- Motion-activated flood lights
- Deter intruders from approaching

**Layer 2: Entry Lighting**
- All doors and windows well-lit
- Motion sensors at each entry
- Eliminate hiding spots

**Layer 3: Pathway Lighting**
- Safe navigation in darkness
- No dark approach areas
- Step and grade change illumination

### Dark Sky Compliance

**Minimize light pollution**:
- Downward-facing fixtures
- Shielded bulbs prevent upward light
- Appropriate brightness levels
- Respect neighbors

**Miami-Dade recommendations**: Use fixtures that direct light downward, reducing sky glow.

### Color Temperature Selection

**Warm white (2700K-3000K)**:
- Welcoming, residential feel
- Best for entry lighting
- Creates inviting ambiance

**Cool white (4000K-5000K)**:
- Alert, security-focused
- Best for flood/motion lights
- Mimics daylight
