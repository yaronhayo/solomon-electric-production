faqs:
  - question: "How often should I have my home's electrical system professionally maintained?"
    answer: "We recommend comprehensive electrical maintenance every 3-5 years for typical homes, annually for homes over 25 years old, and after major electrical events (lightning strikes, power surges, renovations). Regular maintenance identifies developing problems before they cause failures, ensures continued safety, and can prevent costly emergency repairs."
  - question: "What's included in preventive electrical maintenance?"
    answer: "Comprehensive maintenance includes panel inspection and connection tightening, circuit testing for proper voltage and load, GFCI/AFCI testing, outlet and switch inspection, smoke detector testing, thermal imaging to detect hot spots, grounding system verification, and detailed findings report with recommendations. We document everything for your records."
  - question: "Can preventive maintenance prevent electrical emergencies?"
    answer: "Yes, in most cases. Maintenance identifies loose connections before they cause fires, failing breakers before they leave you without power, deteriorating wiring before it shorts, and overloaded circuits before they trip constantly. Most electrical emergencies develop from conditions we can detect and correct during preventive maintenance."
  - question: "What does thermal imaging reveal about my electrical system?"
    answer: "Infrared thermal imaging cameras detect heat differences invisible to naked eyes—loose connections (appear as hot spots), overloaded circuits, failing breakers, panel problems, and deteriorating components. Hot connections generate heat before they fail completely, giving us early warning to prevent problems."
  - question: "Should I have electrical maintenance before selling my Miami home?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Pre-listing electrical maintenance identifies and corrects issues before buyers' inspectors find them, prevents last-minute repair negotiations, demonstrates well-maintained property, and can increase buyer confidence. Many real estate agents now recommend electrical maintenance as part of pre-listing preparation."
  - question: "Does electrical maintenance save money?"
    answer: "Yes, significantly. Early detection prevents expensive emergency repairs, extends component lifespan, improves energy efficiency (loose connections waste power), prevents damage to electronics from power quality issues, and maintains insurance coverage (some policies require maintenance for older homes). ROI is substantial."

# The Maintenance Your Electrical System Needs (But You're Probably Not Doing)

When did you last have your electrical panel inspected? Your circuits tested? Your connections checked?

**If the answer is "never," you're not alone—and you're at risk.**

Electrical systems need regular maintenance just like AC units, roofs, and plumbing. Connections loosen. Components age. Problems develop slowly. Without maintenance, minor issues become expensive emergencies—or worse, fires.

Here's what comprehensive electrical preventive maintenance includes.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Electrical Maintenance FAQ

### Why do electrical systems need maintenance?

**Electrical components degrade over time**:
- Wire connections loosen from thermal cycling
- Breakers wear out from repeated trips
- Corrosion develops (especially in Florida humidity)
- Insulation deteriorates
- Ground connections corrode

**Without maintenance**, these conditions lead to:
- Electrical fires from loose connections
- Equipment failures
- Power quality problems
- Safety hazards

### What's the difference between maintenance and inspection?

**Inspection**: Visual examination, testing for problems
**Maintenance**: Inspection PLUS corrective actions—tightening connections, cleaning corrosion, replacing worn components

**Both are important.** Inspection finds problems; maintenance fixes them before they cause failures.

### Can I do electrical maintenance myself?

**No. Working inside electrical panels is extremely dangerous**:
- Main bus bars remain energized even with main breaker off
- One wrong move can be fatal
- Requires specialized tools and knowledge
- Improperly tightened connections cause more problems

**Licensed electricians** have training, tools, and insurance for safe panel work.

## Comprehensive Maintenance Services

### Panel Inspection & Connection Tightening

**Inside your electrical panel**:
- Inspect all breaker connections
- Tighten all terminal screws to manufacturer torque specs
- Check bus bar connections
- Verify ground and neutral bonding
- Clean corrosion from connections
- Test breaker function

**Why this matters**: Loose connections are the #1 cause of residential electrical fires. Connections loosen over time from heat cycling—tight when installed, loose years later.

### Circuit Load Testing

**Measure actual circuit demand**:
- Clamp meter measures amperage on each circuit
- Compare to breaker rating
- Identify overloaded circuits
- Verify proper wire sizing
- Recommend circuit additions if needed

**Prevents**: Circuit overloads, tripped breakers, fire hazards from undersized circuits.

### GFCI & AFCI Testing

**Test all protection devices**:
- Press test button on GFCI outlets (should trip)
- Test GFCI breakers
- Verify AFCI breakers detect arc faults
- Replace non-functional devices

**GFCI/AFCI save lives**—but only if working properly. Testing ensures functionality.

### Outlet & Switch Inspection

**Check all accessible outlets/switches**:
- Test voltage and polarity
- Verify ground connections
- Check for loose facepl ates
- Identify worn outlets (loose plug fit)
- Replace damaged devices

**Aging outlets crack, discolor, and fail**—regular replacement prevents problems.

### Thermal Imaging Survey

**Infrared camera survey**:
- Scan entire panel for hot spots
- Check service entrance connections
- Identify loose connections anywhere
- Detect overloaded circuits
- Find problems before they fail

**Thermal imaging sees what eyes can't**—heat indicating electrical problems.

### Grounding System Verification

**Test ground integrity**:
- Verify ground rod connections
- Test ground resistance
- Check bonding between systems
- Ensure continuous ground path
- Inspect grounding electrode conductors

**Proper grounding protects against shocks and lightning**.
