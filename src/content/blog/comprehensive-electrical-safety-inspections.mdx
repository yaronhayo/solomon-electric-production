faqs:
  - question: "How often should I have my home's electrical system inspected in Miami?"
    answer: "We recommend comprehensive electrical inspections every 3-5 years for homes, or immediately if you notice warning signs like flickering lights, burning smells, warm outlets, or frequent breaker trips. Additionally, inspections are essential before buying a home, after major renovations, or if your home is over 25 years old."
  - question: "What does an electrical safety inspection include?"
    answer: "A thorough inspection covers your electrical panel and breakers, all visible wiring, outlets and switches, GFCI and AFCI protection, grounding systems, smoke and CO detectors, outdoor electrical, and compliance with current Florida electrical codes. We provide a detailed written report of all findings."
  - question: "How much does an electrical inspection cost in Miami?"
    answer: "Inspection costs vary based on home size and scope. A standard residential inspection for a 2,000 sq ft home typically takes 2-3 hours. The investment is minimal compared to preventing electrical fires or failures. Many buyers request inspections as part of home purchases, and some insurance companies offer discounts for certified safe electrical systems."
  - question: "Will an inspection tell me if my wiring needs to be replaced?"
    answer: "Yes. We identify aluminum wiring, knob-and-tube wiring, deteriorated insulation, improper splices, and other wiring hazards. If rewiring is needed, we'll explain exactly which areas require attention and provide options for remediation—from targeted repairs to complete rewiring."
  - question: "Do I need an inspection before selling my Miami home?"
    answer: "While not legally required, it's highly recommended. Pre-listing inspections let you address issues before buyers find them, preventing last-minute negotiation problems. Many real estate agents now advise sellers to get electrical inspections, especially for homes over 20 years old or with visible electrical concerns."
  - question: "Can inspections identify why my breakers keep tripping?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Frequent breaker trips indicate overloaded circuits, failing breakers, short circuits, or ground faults. Our inspection identifies the root cause—whether it's undersized circuits, too many devices on one circuit, defective breakers, or wiring problems—and recommends the appropriate solution."

# The Electrical Safety Inspection Nobody Wants—Until They Need It

Most homeowners don't think about their electrical system until something goes wrong. A light switch that sparks. A breaker that keeps tripping. An outlet that feels warm.

By then, you're often dealing with an expensive repair—or worse, an electrical fire.

**Electrical safety inspections find problems before they find you.** In South Florida's humid climate, with homes ranging from 1920s Coral Gables historic properties to modern Brickell high-rises, electrical systems face unique stresses that make regular inspections critical.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Electrical Inspection FAQ

### How often should I inspect my electrical system?

**Every 3-5 years for routine maintenance.** Immediate inspection if:
- You buy a home (pre-purchase inspection)
- Your home is over 25 years old
- You notice any warning signs (flickering, buzzing, burning smells)
- After a lightning strike or power surge
- Before major renovations
- You're selling your home
- Your insurance company requests it

### What exactly do you inspect?

**Everything electrical:**
- Main electrical panel and all breakers
- Sub-panels and disconnects
- Service entrance and weather head
- All visible wiring throughout the home
- Outlets, switches, and junction boxes
- GFCI protection (bathrooms, kitchen, garage, outdoor)
- AFCI protection (bedrooms, living areas)
- Grounding and bonding systems
- Smoke detectors and CO detectors
- Outdoor electrical (pool, AC, landscape lighting)
- Code compliance with current NEC and Florida Building Code

You receive a comprehensive written report with photos documenting all findings.

### Will you find every problem?

We inspect everything accessible without demolition. This includes:
- ✅ All exposed wiring in attics, crawl spaces, garage
- ✅ Inside panels and junction boxes
- ✅ Testing all outlets and switches
- ✅ Infrared thermography for hidden hot spots

We cannot see:
- ❌ Wiring inside closed walls (unless we use thermal imaging)

## Why Miami Homes Need Regular Electrical Inspections

### The Florida Climate Factor

South Florida's environment is harsh on electrical systems:

**Humidity**: Constant moisture causes:
- Corrosion on electrical connections
- Deterioration of wire insulation
- Rust on panel components
- Mold growth in junction boxes

**Heat**: Year-round AC usage means:
- Circuits running near capacity constantly
- Higher risk of connection failures from thermal expansion/contraction
- Accelerated aging of components

**Storms**: Hurricane season brings:
- Lightning strikes and surges
- Flooding that compromises ground-level electrical
- Wind damage to service drops and weather heads

### The Aging Home Problem

Miami-Dade and Broward have thousands of homes from the 1960s-1980s boom. These homes often have:

**Federal Pacific Panels**: Known fire hazards with breakers that don't trip
**Zinsco Panels**: Similar dangerous failure-to-trip issues
**Aluminum Wiring**: Installed 1965-1973, prone to overheating at connections
**Insufficient Capacity**: 100-amp service that can't handle modern loads
**Missing GFCI Protection**: Code now requires GFCIs in many locations
**No AFCI Protection**: Modern code requires AFCI breakers for most circuits

An inspection identifies these hazards before they cause fires.

### The Home-Buying Scenario

If you're buying a home in Miami, **never skip the electrical inspection.** Home inspectors do a basic electrical check, but they're generalists, not electricians.

We regularly find serious problems home inspectors miss:
- Improper panel wiring (double-tapped breakers, reversed polarity)
- Aluminum wiring splice failures
- Missing ground wires
- Improper outdoor wiring
- Code violations that affect insurance coverage

A $300-500 electrical inspection can save you $10,000+ in unexpected repairs.

## What Our Comprehensive Inspection Includes

### 1. Electrical Panel Deep Dive

We don't just look at the panel—we open it and examine:
- **Main breaker**: Proper size, tight connections, no corrosion
- **All branch breakers**: Correct amp rating, proper termination, no burnt connections
- **Bus bars**: No signs of overheating, proper lubrication
- **Grounding and bonding**: Proper size, tight connections, code compliance
- **Panel brand**: Identify Federal Pacific, Zinsco, or other problematic brands
- **Labeling**: Circuits should be clearly labeled
- **Available capacity**: Room for additional circuits if needed

**What we find**: Double-tapped breakers (two wires on one breaker—a code violation), oversized breakers protecting undersized wire (fire hazard), corroded connections, and improperly installed breakers.

### 2. Wiring Evaluation

We trace visible wiring in:
- Attics
- Crawl spaces
- Garages
- Basements (rare in South Florida, but we check when present)
- Exposed areas

**What we check**:
- Wire type (copper vs. aluminum)
- Insulation condition (cracked, frayed, deteriorated)
- Proper wire size for circuit protection
- Junction box accessibility and proper covering
- Romex vs. conduit (conduit required in many areas)
- Knob-and-tube or cloth-wrapped wiring (needs replacement)

**What we find**: Splices buried in walls (code violation), undersized wire, deteriorated insulation exposing bare copper, and improper connections.

### 3. Outlet and Switch Testing

Every accessible outlet and switch gets tested:
- **Voltage testing**: Verify proper 120V
- **Polarity testing**: Hot and neutral correct
- **Ground testing**: Proper ground connection
- **GFCI testing**: All GFCIs trip and reset properly
- **AFCI testing**: Bedroom and living area AFCI breakers function
- **Visual inspection**: Cracks, discoloration, loose faceplate

**What we find**: Ungrounded outlets (two-prong), missing GFCIs where required, reversed polarity (hot/neutral swapped), loose connections, and worn-out devices.

### 4. Grounding System Verification

Proper grounding protects you from shocks and surges. We verify:
- Ground rod(s) present and properly installed
- Bonding between electrical system and water/gas lines
- Ground wire continuity throughout system
- Proper grounding in pools, spas, and outdoor equipment

**What we find**: Missing ground rods, improper bonding, disconnected ground wires, and code violations in pool grounding.

### 5. Service Entrance Inspection

The service entrance is where power enters your home from FPL:
- Weather head condition
- Service drop attachment
- Meter base security
- Service cable condition
- Clearances from windows, doors, and grade

**What we find**: Damaged weather heads allowing water intrusion, loose service cables, improperly secured meter bases, and clearance violations.
