faqs:
  - question: "Why does my ceiling fan wobble and how do you fix it?"
    answer: "Ceiling fan wobbling results from unbalanced blades, loose mounting hardware, bent blade irons, or improper ceiling box installation. We fix wobbles by checking blade balance, tightening all connections, ensuring the mounting bracket is secure to ceiling joists, and using balancing kits when needed. Properly installed fans should run smoothly without noticeable wobble."
  - question: "Can you install a ceiling fan where I have a light fixture now?"
    answer: "Yes, but the existing electrical box must be fan-rated. Standard light fixture boxes aren't strong enough to support ceiling fan weight and vibration. We inspect the existing box and either upgrade to a fan-rated box (required) or install proper fan-rated support bracing between ceiling joists before installation."
  - question: "What size ceiling fan do I need for my room?"
    answer: "Fan size depends on room dimensions: up to 75 sq ft = 29-36 inch fan; 76-144 sq ft = 36-42 inch fan; 144-225 sq ft = 44-50 inch fan; 225-400 sq ft = 50-54 inch fan; over 400 sq ft needs multiple fans or industrial sizes. Blade pitch and motor quality matter as much as diameter for effective air movement."
  - question: "Should ceiling fans run year-round in Miami?"
    answer: "Yes. In summer, run fans counter-clockwise to push air down for cooling effect. In winter (Miami's cooler months), run clockwise on low to gently circulate warm air trapped near ceiling. Fans make rooms feel 4-8 degrees cooler, reducing AC load and electricity costs year-round."
  - question: "Can you install ceiling fans in rooms with low ceilings?"
    answer: "Yes, using hugger/flush-mount fans that sit close to ceiling (no downrod). Code requires minimum 7-foot clearance from floor to blade bottom. For 8-foot ceilings common in Florida homes, hugger mounts work perfectly. For higher ceilings (9+ feet), downrod extensions improve air circulation by positioning fan at optimal height."
  - question: "Do ceiling fans need to be on a dedicated circuit?"
    answer: "Not typically. Ceiling fans draw minimal power (50-90 watts), so they usually share circuits with lights. However, for high-watt fans with integrated lights and heaters, we may recommend dedicated circuits. We evaluate your panel capacity and circuit load to determine the best approach."

# Cool Comfort Without the AC Bill

Your air conditioning bill in Miami is probably brutal—$300, $400, even $500 during peak summer months. Your AC runs constantly fighting 95-degree heat and oppressive humidity.

**Ceiling fans can't replace AC in South Florida, but they make your AC work less**. By circulating air effectively, ceiling fans create a cooling effect that lets you raise your thermostat 3-4 degrees while feeling just as comfortable. That translates to real savings: every degree you raise your thermostat saves approximately 7-10% on cooling costs.

But only if they're installed correctly, balanced properly, and running smoothly.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Ceiling Fan FAQ

### Do I really need a professional to install a ceiling fan?

**Yes—and here's why**: Ceiling fans seem simple, but installation involves:
- Ensuring proper fan-rated electrical box (standard boxes can't handle the weight)
- Mounting securely to ceiling joists or bracing
- Correct wiring for fan and light kit
- Proper downrod length for ceiling height
- Blade balancing for wobble-free operation
- Ensuring adequate clearance (7 feet minimum from floor)

DIY installations often result in wobbling fans, electrical issues, or worst case—fans falling from ceilings. We've seen all three.

### Why is my new fan wobbling?

Common causes:
- Blades not balanced (manufacturing variance)
- Loose mounting screws at ceiling bracket
- Bent blade irons (arms holding blades)
- Improper ceiling box installation
- Warped blades
- Motor housing not level

We diagnose and fix wobbles using balancing kits, tightening hardware, or correcting mounting issues.

### Which direction should my ceiling fan spin?

**Summer (most of the year in Miami)**: Counter-clockwise (when looking up). Pushes air down for cooling breeze.

**Winter (Dec-Feb)**: Clockwise on low speed. Gently circulates warm air trapped at ceiling without creating strong downdraft.

## Professional Installation Benefits

### Proper Electrical Box Installation

**The foundation of safe ceiling fan installation**:

Standard electrical boxes are rated for 50 pounds—fine for light fixtures, inadequate for ceiling fans. Ceiling fans:
- Weigh 15-50+ pounds depending on size
- Create vibration during operation
- Generate dynamic load (movement stress)

**We install fan-rated boxes**:
- For accessible ceiling joists: Screw-on pancake box or fan bracket
- For inaccessible joists: Adjustable bracing between joists
- For concrete ceilings: Specialized anchors rated for fan weight

Your fan won't fall. Guaranteed.

### Optimal Fan Sizing & Placement

**Room size determines fan size**:
- Small rooms (up to 75 sq ft): 29-36" diameter
- Medium rooms (76-144 sq ft): 36-42" diameter  
- Large rooms (144-225 sq ft): 44-50" diameter
- Great rooms (225-400 sq ft): 50-54" diameter or multiple fans

**Ceiling height determines downrod length**:
- 8-9 foot ceilings: Hugger mount (no downrod)
- 9-10 foot ceilings: 6" downrod
- 10-12 foot ceilings: 12-24" downrod
- Higher ceilings: Longer downrods for optimal blade height

**Blade height sweet spot**: 8-9 feet from floor for best air circulation.

### Balancing for Quiet Operation

**Professional balancing process**:
1. Install fan and run on high speed
2. Identify which blade position causes wobble
3. Use balancing kit (small weights) on blade brackets
4. Test and adjust until wobble eliminated
5. Secure all balance weights permanently

**Quiet operation targets**: Properly balanced fans are barely audible even on high speed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Fan Wobbling Excessively

**Diagnosis steps**:
- Check all mounting screws (ceiling bracket and motor housing)
- Measure blade heights (should be equal within 1/8 inch)
- Check blade to blade holder screws
- Test with one blade removed (identifies specific problematic blade)

**Solutions**:
- Tighten all connections
- Balance blades with balancing kit
- Replace bent blade irons
- Remount ceiling bracket square to joists

### Fan Making Noise

**Common noise sources**:
- Loose screws vibrating
- Motor bearings wearing out
- Light kit rattling
- Blade brackets rubbing motor housing

**We diagnose and fix** each noise source appropriately.

### Fan Not Moving Enough Air

**Possible causes**:
- Fan too small for room size
- Blade pitch too shallow
- Motor underpowered
- Fan mounted too high or low
- Running in wrong direction

**Solutions often involve**: Upgrading to larger fan, adjusting height, or verifying rotation direction.

## Energy Savings in South Florida

**Real cost savings from ceiling fans**:

Ceiling fan operating cost: ~$0.50-1.00/month per fan
AC operating cost: ~$150-400/month

**By raising thermostat 4 degrees with fans running**:
- AC energy savings: 28-40% reduction
- Monthly savings: $40-160 depending on AC usage
- Annual savings: $480-1,920

**Ceiling fan pays for itself in first summer.**
