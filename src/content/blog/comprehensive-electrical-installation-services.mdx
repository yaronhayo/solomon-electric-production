faqs:
  - question: "What's included in complete electrical installation for new construction?"
    answer: "Complete installation includes electrical service sizing and installation, main panel and sub-panels, all branch circuit wiring, outlets and switches throughout, lighting fixtures and ceiling fans, GFCI and AFCI protection, smoke and CO detectors, exterior lighting, pool/spa electrical, EV charger circuits, smart home pre-wiring, and final inspection coordination."
  - question: "How do you size electrical service for a new home in Miami?"
    answer: "We perform NEC load calculations considering square footage, AC tonnage, kitchen appliances, pool equipment, EV chargers, and future expansion. Most modern Miami homes need 200-amp service minimum. Larger homes (3,000+ sq ft) with pools, workshops, or multiple AC units often require 400-amp service."
  - question: "Can you handle electrical for room additions and major renovations?"
    answer: "Yes. We design and install electrical for additions, kitchen/bathroom renovations, converting garages, finishing basements, adding pools, and whole-home renovations. This includes panel upgrades if needed, new circuits, updated wiring to code, GFCI/AFCI protection, and permit coordination with Miami-Dade or Broward building departments."
  - question: "Do you coordinate with other trades during construction?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We coordinate with general contractors, framers, HVAC, plumbers, and other trades for proper rough-in timing, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring efficient construction flow. We attend construction meetings, provide electrical plans, and work within overall project schedules."
  - question: "What smart home pre-wiring should I include in new construction?"
    answer: "We recommend Cat6 ethernet throughout for future-proof networking, conduit runs for easy wire additions, extra circuits in media areas, USP outlets for networking equipment, outdoor camera circuits, motorized shade circuits, whole-home audio pre-wire, and central wiring closet for smart home hubs."
  - question: "How long does electrical installation take for new construction?"
    answer: "Timeline depends on home size and complexity. Typical single-family home: 3-5 days for rough-in (before drywall), 2-3 days for trim-out (after drywall). Larger custom homes take longer. We coordinate with construction schedule to avoid delays and ensure inspections happen on time."

## Building Right From the Start

You're building your dream home or transforming your existing space with a major renovation. **The electrical system is the invisible infrastructure that powers everything**.

Get it right now, or pay dearly later. Undersized panels. Insufficient circuits. Poor planning. These mistakes haunt homeowners for decades—and cost thousands to fix.

Here's how professional electrical installation creates the foundation for modern, safe, future-ready homes.

## Quick Answers: Electrical Installation FAQ

### How do I know what size electrical service I need?

**We calculate based on**:
- Home square footage
- Number and size of AC units
- Kitchen appliances (electric range, ovens)
- Pool/spa equipment
- EV chargers (each needs 40-50 amps)
- Workshop or home gym equipment
- Future expansion plans

**Typical Miami homes**:
- 1,500-2,500 sq ft: 200 amps
- 2,500-4,000 sq ft: 200-400 amps
- 4,000+ sq ft or multiple large loads: 400 amps

### Should I future-proof my electrical system?

**Absolutely.** Today's luxury is tomorrow's standard:
- EV chargers (will you buy electric vehicles?)
- Solar panels + battery storage
- Home automation systems
- Home offices (more circuits, dedicated internet)
- Outdoor kitchens and living spaces

**Adding capacity later is expensive.** We design systems with 20-30% growth capacity.

### What's the difference between rough-in and trim-out?

**Rough-in** (before drywall):
- Install electrical panel
- Run all wiring in walls/ceiling/attic
- Install electrical boxes for outlets/switches
- Rough-in inspection before drywall closes walls

**Trim-out** (after drywall, painting):
- Install outlets, switches, fixtures
- Connect panel circuits
- Install smoke detectors
- Test all systems
- Final inspection
