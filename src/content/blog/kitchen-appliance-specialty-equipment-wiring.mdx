Kitchen Appliance & Specialty Equipment Wiring

From built-in ovens to commercial-grade appliances, our team provides safe, dedicated circuit wiring.

## Powering the Culinary Heart
The modern kitchen is a high-demand energy zone. Induction cooktops, double convection ovens, and professional-grade refrigerators require precise, dedicated circuits to operate safely and efficiently. We specialize in the complex wiring needed for these high-draw appliances, ensuring they perform at their peak without overloading your general household circuits.

### Specialty Equipment Expertise
Beyond the kitchen, we provide expert power solutions for specialty equipment throughout your home, from wine cellar cooling units to workshop machinery. We understand the specific voltage and amperage requirements of sophisticated equipment and install the precise infrastructure they demand.

*   **Dedicated Circuits:** Preventing breaker trips by isolating high-power appliances on their own lines.
*   **Heavy-Duty Receptacles:** Installing the correct NEMA outlets for ranges, dryers, and welders.
*   **Code Compliance:** Ensuring all installations meet the strict NEC requirements for kitchen and specialty wiring.
