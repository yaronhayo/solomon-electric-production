faqs:
  - question: "What appliances need 240V circuits in my kitchen?"
    answer: "Electric ranges/ovens (40-50 amps), cooktops (30-40 amps), wall ovens (30-50 amps), commercial-grade refrigerators, tankless water heaters, and some high-powered microwaves require dedicated 240V circuits. Dishwashers, disposals, and standard refrigerators use 120V circuits."
  - question: "Can I convert my gas range to electric?"
    answer: "Yes. We install new 240V 40-50 amp circuits with proper wire gauge (typically 6 AWG copper), dedicated breaker, and correct outlet type (NEMA 14-50 most common for ranges). We route wire from panel to range location, install proper outlet, and ensure code compliance. Gas lines should be professionally capped."
  - question: "Do induction cooktops require special wiring?"
    answer: "Induction cooktops typically require 240V 30-40 amp circuits depending on wattage. Some high-power models need 50 amps. We size circuits based on manufacturer specifications, install proper breakers, and ensure adequate panel capacity. Induction cooktops are more energy-efficient but draw significant instantaneous power."
  - question: "Can my electrical panel handle adding a 240V kitchen appliance?"
    answer: "It depends on your panel size and current load. Most 200-amp panels can accommodate kitchen appliances. 100-amp panels often need upgrades when adding multiple 240V circuits. We perform load calculations to verify capacity before installation. Many Miami homes need panel upgrades when renovating kitchens."
  - question: "What's the difference between 3-prong and 4-prong range outlets?"
    answer: "Older ranges used 3-prong outlets (hot-hot-neutral, with neutral serving as ground). Modern code requires 4-prong outlets (hot-hot-neutral-ground) with separate ground wire for safety. New range installations must use 4-prong. Existing 3-prong can remain but should be upgraded for safety."
  - question: "Do kitchen appliances need GFCI protection?"
    answer: "Florida code requires GFCI protection for kitchen countertop outlets within 6 feet of sinks. Large appliances (ranges, dishwashers, disposals, refrigerators) typically don't require GFCI protection and are often on dedicated non-GFCI circuits to prevent nuisance tripping with large motor loads."

## When Your Kitchen Needs More Power

You're renovating your Miami kitchen. Out goes the builder-grade gas range. In comes a sleek induction cooktop, double wall ovens, and a commercial-grade refrigerator.

**Your electrician breaks the news**: Your 100-amp panel can't handle it.

Modern kitchens are power-hungry. Between high-wattage appliances, task lighting, and specialty equipment, today's kitchens often draw more power than entire 1970s homes. Here's how to wire them safely and to code.

## Quick Answers: Kitchen Wiring FAQ

### What size circuit does my electric range need?

**Most electric ranges require 40-50 amp 240V circuits with 6 AWG or 8 AWG copper wire.** The exact requirement depends on the range's power rating:

- **Standard ranges**: 40 amps (8 AWG wire)
- **High-power/double-oven ranges**: 50 amps (6 AWG wire)
- **Commercial-style ranges**: Sometimes 60 amps (4 AWG wire)

We size circuits based on manufacturer specifications and NEC requirements—never guess.

### Can I plug a new range into my old outlet?

**Only if the outlet matches the range's plug configuration.** Ranges come with either:
- **3-prong plugs**: Older standard (hot-hot-neutral)
- **4-prong plugs**: Modern standard (hot-hot-neutral-ground)

**Most new ranges come with 4-prong plugs**. If your house has a 3-prong outlet, we upgrade to 4-prong for safety (separate ground wire).

### How much does it cost to add a 240V circuit for a kitchen appliance?

Cost varies based on:
- Distance from panel to appliance location
- Wire routing difficulty (through walls, attic, crawl space)
- Need for drywall repair
- Type of circuit (30A, 40A, 50A)
- Panel capacity (does panel need upgrade?)

We provide upfront estimates after assessing your specific situation.

## Common Kitchen Appliance Wiring Requirements

### Electric Ranges & Ovens

**Circuit requirements**:
- **Voltage**: 240V
- **Amperage**: 40-50 amps (some commercial units require 60A)
- **Wire gauge**: 6 AWG or 8 AWG copper (depends on amp rating and distance)
- **Breaker**: Double-pole breaker (both hot wires on same handle)
- **Outlet**: NEMA 14-50 (50A, 4-prong) most common

**Installation process**:
1. Calculate exact amperage requirement from range specs
2. Install appropriate double-pole breaker in panel
3. Run proper gauge wire from panel to range location
4. Install 4-prong outlet (NEMA 14-50 or hard-wire)
5. Test voltage, polarity, and ground
6. Connect and test range

### Induction & Electric Cooktops

**Why induction cooktops are popular in Miami**:
- More energy-efficient than gas or standard electric
- Faster heating (water boils in half the time)
- Cooler kitchen (less heat output)
- Precise temperature control

**Circuit requirements**:
- **30-inch cooktops**: Typically 30-40 amps
- **36-inch+ cooktops**: Often 40-50 amps
- **Commercial induction**: Can exceed 50 amps

**Hard-wire vs. plug-in**: Most cooktops are hardwired directly (no outlet). We install junction box behind/below unit for connection.

### Wall Ovens

**Single wall ovens**:
- 30-40 amp circuits
- Often hardwired
- Can share circuit with cooktop if combined load allows

**Double wall ovens**:
- 40-50 amp circuits
- Always dedicated circuit
- Higher power consumption than single ovens

### Dishwashers

**Circuit requirements**:
- **Voltage**: 120V
- **Amperage**: 15-20 amps
- **Dedicated circuit**: Required by code
- **GFCI protection**: Not typically required (hard-wired appliance)

**Installation location**: Under sink area or adjacent cabinet with hardwired connection.

### Garbage Disposals

**Circuit requirements**:
- **Voltage**: 120V
- **Amperage**: 15-20 amps
- **Dedicated circuit**: Recommended (often shares with dishwasher)
- **GFCI**: Code requires GFCI protection
- **Switch**: Wall switch above counter required

### Microwaves

**Built-in/over-range microwaves**:
- 120V, 15-20 amp dedicated circuit
- Some high-power models need 20A
- Often hardwired behind unit

**Countertop microwaves**:
- Plug into standard 120V outlet
- Don't need dedicated circuit

## Specialty & Commercial Equipment

### Commercial-Grade Ranges

**Wolf, Viking, BlueStar commercial-style ranges**:
- Often require 50-60 amp circuits
- May need special ventilation electrical (hood fans)
- Higher BTU ratings demand more power
- Sometimes require dual fuel (gas + electric)

**Dual fuel electrical requirements**: Electric oven portion still needs 240V circuit even if cooktop is gas.

### Wine Refrigerators & Beverage Centers

**Dedicated circuits recommended**:
- Prevent power interruptions from other appliances
- 120V 15-20 amp circuits
- Temperature-sensitive storage benefits from circuit stability

### Espresso Machines & Coffee Makers

**High-end built-in coffee systems**:
- 120V or 240V depending on model
- 15-20 amp dedicated circuits
- Often hardwired behind cabinetry

### Warming Drawers

**Circuit requirements**:
- 120V or 240V (model-dependent)
- 15-20 amps
- Can share circuit with wall oven circuit if load allows
- Often hardwired

## Kitchen Renovation Electrical Considerations

### Panel Capacity Planning

**Typical modern Miami kitchen electrical load**:
- Electric range: 40-50 amps (240V)
- Cooktop: 30-40 amps (240V)
- Wall oven(s): 30-50 amps (240V)
- Dishwasher: 15 amps (120V)
- Disposal: 15 amps (120V)
- Refrigerator: 15-20 amps (120V)
- Microwave: 15-20 amps (120V)
- Small appliance circuits: 40 amps total (two 20A circuits)
- Lighting: 15 amps

**Total**: 200+ amps of circuits (though not all run simultaneously)

**Many 100-amp panels can't support modern kitchens**. We often recommend 200-amp panel upgrades during major kitchen renovations.

### Small Appliance Circuits

**Code requires**: Two 20-amp 120V circuits serving countertop outlets for small appliances (toasters, blenders, mixers, etc.).

**These circuits cannot serve**:
- Refrigerator
- Dishwasher
- Disposal
- Microwave
- Lighting

### GFCI Requirements

**GFCI protection required in kitchens**:
- All countertop outlets within 6 feet of sink
- All countertop outlets serving counter surfaces

**GFCI not typically used for**:
- Refrigerator (nuisance tripping concerns)
- Dishwasher (hardwired appliance)
- Disposal (hardwired appliance)
- Hood fan
