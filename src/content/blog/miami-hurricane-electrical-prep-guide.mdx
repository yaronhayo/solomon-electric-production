## ⚡ Quick Answers: Hurricane Electrical Safety

### When should I test my generator?
**Test your generator at least 30 days before hurricane season begins (June 1st).** Run it for 20-30 minutes under load to ensure it's functioning correctly. Do not wait for a hurricane watch to test it.

### Can I plug a generator into a wall outlet?
**No, never backfeed a generator into a wall outlet.** This is illegal and dangerous. It can electrocute utility workers trying to restore power. Always use a professionally installed **transfer switch** or **interlock kit**.

### Do I need whole-home surge protection?
**Yes, we highly recommend it.** Lightning strikes and power surges during storms can destroy expensive appliances (AC units, refrigerators, computers) instantly. A panel-mounted surge protector offers the best defense.

## The Essential Pre-Storm Checklist

### 1. Inspect Your Service Mast & Weatherhead
The pipe connecting your meter to the utility lines (the "weatherhead") is **your responsibility**, not FPL's. 
- Look for rust, cracks, or loose straps.
- Ensure tree branches are trimmed at least 10 feet away.
- *Tip:* If this is damaged during a storm, FPL cannot reconnect your power until a licensed electrician repairs it.

### 2. Test Your GCFI Outlets
Water and electricity are a deadly mix. Ensure all outdoor, kitchen, and bathroom outlets have working Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs). Press the "TEST" button; it should click and cut power. Press "RESET" to restore it. 

### 3. Secure Outdoor Electrical Equipment
- Tighten bolts on outdoor lighting fixtures.
- Secure pool pump covers.
- If you have a dock in Miami Beach or Ft. Lauderdale, turn off the breaker to the dock pedestal to prevent underwater electrical hazards during storm surges.

## Generator Safety: Portable vs. Standby

Thinking about backup power? Here is the breakdown for South Florida homes:

### Portable Generators (Good)
- **Pros:** Lower cost, mobile.
- **Cons:** Requires manual setup, fueling, and a safe storage spot.
- **Requirement:** Must run **outside**, at least 20 feet from windows/doors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Requires a manual transfer switch for safe home connection.

### Whole-Home Standby Generators (Best)
- **Pros:** Automatic activation (seconds after outage), runs on Natural Gas/Propane, powers entire home (AC included).
- **Cons:** Higher investment, requires permitting.
- **Verdict:** For maximum safety and comfort in Miami heat, a standby generator is the superior choice.

## What To Do After The Storm

1.  **Main Breaker First:** If power is out, turn off your **Main Breaker**. This prevents a massive power surge when the grid comes back online ("cold load pickup") which can damage your internal wiring.
2.  **Visual Inspection:** Before turning anything back on, check for water damage near the panel or outlets.
3.  **Wait 15 Minutes:** Once you see neighbors have power, wait 10-15 minutes before switching your Main Breaker back on to ensure grid stability.
