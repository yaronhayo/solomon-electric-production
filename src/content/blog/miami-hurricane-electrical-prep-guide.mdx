faqs:
  - question: "When should I test my generator?"
    answer: "Testing a generator at least 30 days before the start of the hurricane season (June 1st) allows for the identification of potential mechanical issues. Running the unit under load verifies functional capability."
  - question: "Can I plug a generator into a wall outlet?"
    answer: "No, 'backfeeding' a generator into a wall outlet is hazardous and prohibited. A professionally installed transfer switch or interlock kit is required for safe operation."
  - question: "Do I need whole-home surge protection?"
    answer: "Surge protection is recommended in Florida to mitigate the risk of damage from lightning-induced voltage spikes. A panel-mounted protector offers a layer of defense for residential appliances."

# Is Your Miami Home Electrically Ready for the 2026 Hurricane Season?

Living in South Florida means hurricane preparation is a non-negotiable part of life. While you might stock up on water and batteries, **your home's electrical system often gets overlooked until the power goes out.**

Licensed Miami electricians identify several key areas of concern that property owners should address prior to the 2026 storm season.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Hurricane Electrical Safety

### When should I test my generator?
**Test your generator at least 30 days before hurricane season begins (June 1st).** Running the unit under load for a period of time ensures it's functioning correctly. Waiting for a hurricane watch to perform testing is discouraged.

### Can I plug a generator into a wall outlet?
**No, never backfeed a generator into a wall outlet.** This is hazardous and can result in the electrocution of utility workers. A professionally installed **transfer switch** or **interlock kit** is the required method for home connection.

### Do I need whole-home surge protection?
**Yes, it is recommended.** Lightning strikes and power surges can affect sensitive residential appliances. A panel-mounted protector like our [Whole-Home Surge Protection](/services/whole-home-surge-protection) is a standard mitigation strategy.

## The Essential 2026 Pre-Storm Checklist

### 1. Inspect Your Service Mast & Weatherhead
The structural pipe (weatherhead) connecting the meter to the utility lines is the responsibility of the property owner. 
- Conduct a visual check for rust, cracks, or loose mounting straps.
- Verify that tree branches are positioned away from service lines.
- *Note:* Damage to these components typically requires a [Storm Damage Repair](/services/storm-damage-electrical-repair) before utility service can be restored.

### 2. Test Your GFCI Outlets
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are required in areas where water and electricity may interact. Use the "TEST" button to verify that the internal safety switch is functioning correctly.

### 3. Secure Outdoor Electrical Equipment
- Verify the mounting of outdoor lighting fixtures and pool pump covers.
- For properties with docks, the breaker to the dock pedestal should be deactivated during storm surges to mitigate underwater electrical hazards.

## Generator Safety: Portable vs. Standby

The selection of backup power involves different technical requirements:

### Portable Generators
- **Pros:** Mobility and deployment flexibility.
- **Cons:** Requirement for manual fueling and an appropriate outdoor operating location.
- **Safety:** Must be operated at least 20 feet from windows and doors. Requires a manual transfer switch for a safe electrical connection to the property.

### Whole-Home Standby Generators
- **Pros:** Automatic activation during grid failure and integration with natural gas or propane systems.
- **Cons:** Requirement for fixed installation and municipal permitting.
- **Verdict:** Standby generators provide a more comprehensive solution for maintaining cooling and power during extended outages.

## What To Do After The Storm

1.  **Main Breaker Management:** During an outage, deactivating the **Main Breaker** can prevent power surges when grid stability is initially restored.
2.  **Visual Hazard Check:** Inspect the area around electrical panels and outlets for signs of water intrusion before reactivity.
3.  **Grid Stability Wait:** Following the restoration of power to the neighborhood, observing a waiting period before activating the property's main breaker allows for grid stabilization.

If sparking or burning smells are observed after power restoration, the system requires professional attention through an [Emergency Electrical Service](/services/24-7-emergency-electrical-service).
