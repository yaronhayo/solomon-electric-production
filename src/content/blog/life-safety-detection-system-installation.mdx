faqs:
  - question: "Where does Florida code require smoke detectors?"
    answer: "Florida Building Code requires smoke detectors in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, on every level of the home including basements, and interconnected (when one sounds, all sound). New construction requires hardwired detectors with battery backup. Existing homes can use battery-powered detectors but hardwired are recommended for reliability."
  - question: "What's the difference между hardwired and battery smoke detectors?"
    answer: "Hardwired smoke detectors connect to home electrical system with battery backup, providing reliable power and the ability to interconnect (all alarms sound when one triggers). Battery-only detectors are simpler to install but require regular battery changes, can't interconnect easily, and may fail if batteries die. Hardwired are superior for life safety."
  - question: "Do I need carbon monoxide detectors in Florida?"
    answer: "Yes, if your home has fuel-burning appliances (gas water heater, furnace, fireplace) or attached garage. CO detectors should be installed outside each sleeping area and on every level. While not required in all-electric homes, we still recommend them—garage vehicles, generators, or future gas appliances make them valuable."
  - question: "How often should smoke detectors be replaced?"
    answer: "Every 10 years regardless of apparent function. Smoke detector sensors degrade over time, reducing sensitivity. Check manufacture date on detector back—if over 10 years old, replace immediately. Carbon monoxide detectors also need replacement every 5-7 years depending on model."
  - question: "Why do smoke detectors beep randomly and how do you fix it?"
    answer: "Random chirping usually indicates low battery in battery-backup unit. Replace 9V batteries in all hardwired detectors annually. Other causes: end-of-life warning (replace unit), dust accumulation (vacuum detector), temperature fluctuations, or steam from bathrooms. We diagnose and fix all detector issues."
  - question: "Can you install interconnected smoke detectors without running new wires?"
    answer: "Yes, using wireless interconnected smoke detectors. Modern systems use RF (radio frequency) to interconnect without physical wiring—perfect for retrofitting existing homes. All major brands offer wireless interconnection. We install hardwired where possible (new construction, accessible attics) and wireless where running wires is impractical."

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Smoke Detector FAQ

### Where exactly do I need smoke detectors?

**Florida code requirements**:
- Inside every bedroom
- Outside each sleeping area (hallway outside bedrooms)
- On every level of the home
- In basements (if applicable)

**Additional recommended locations**:
- Living rooms
- Kitchens (with photoelectric detectors to reduce cooking false alarms)
- Laundry rooms
- Garages (heat detectors, not smoke)

### Hardwired vs. battery-only—which is better?

**Hardwired detectors are superior**:
- Never die from dead batteries (backup batteries only for power outages)
- Easy to interconnect (all alarms sound when one triggers)
- More reliable long-term
- Required in new construction

**Battery-only acceptable for**:
- Existing homes (retrofit)
- Adding detectors beyond code minimum
- Temporary solutions

### How do interconnected smoke detectors work?

**When one detector senses smoke, all detectors alarm simultaneously**. This ensures:
- Bedroom occupants hear alarm even if fire is distant
- Faster response time
- Better chance of safe evacuation

**Interconnection methods**:
- **Hardwired**: Physical wire between all detectors
- **Wireless RF**: Radio frequency communication (no wires needed)
- **Hybrid**: Combination of both

## Types of Smoke & Safety Detectors

### Ionization Smoke Detectors

**How they work**:
- Detect fast-flaming fires quickly
- Use small radioactive source to ionize air
- Respond rapidly to visible flames

**Best for**: Areas prone to fast-burning fires (paper, wood)

**Drawback**: More prone to false alarms from cooking

### Photoelectric Smoke Detectors

**How they work**:
- Detect slow-smoldering fires earlier
- Use light beam to sense smoke particles
- Better for electrical fires, upholstery fires

**Best for**: Kitchens, living areas (fewer false alarms)

**Advantage**: Less sensitive to cooking smoke

### Dual-Sensor Detectors

**Combine both technologies**:
- Ionization + photoelectric in one unit
- Best overall protection
- Respond to both fast and slow fires

**We recommend dual-sensor** for most installations—comprehensive protection.

### Carbon Monoxide Detectors

**Essential for homes with**:
- Gas appliances (water heaters, ranges, dryers)
- Fireplaces or wood stoves
- Attached garages (vehicle exhaust)
- Generators

**CO is odorless, col orless, and deadly**. Detectors must be:
- Outside each sleeping area
- On every level
- Not in garages (exhaust causes false alarms)

### Combination Smoke + CO Detectors

**Single unit provides both**:
- Smoke detection
- Carbon monoxide detection
- Reduces number of devices needed

**Perfect for**: Bedrooms, hallways outside sleeping areas

## Professional Installation Process

### Step 1: Compliance Assessment

We evaluate:
- Current detector locations vs. code requirements
- Detector ages (replace if over 10 years)
- Interconnection status
- Battery vs. hardwired
- CO detector needs

### Step 2: System Design

We plan:
- Detector placement per code and best practices
- Interconnection wiring routes
- Circuit integration (detectors usually share lighting circuit)
- Combination units vs. separate devices

### Step 3: Installation

**Hardwired smoke detectors**:
- Run 14/3 wire from first detector to panel (or tap lighting circuit)
- Run 14/3 interconnect wire between all detectors
- Mount electrical boxes at proper locations
- Wire detectors with interconnect traveler
- Install backup batteries
- Test all interconnections

**Wireless interconnected**:
- Mount detectors at code-required locations
- Program RF interconnection
- Test communication between units
- Install batteries

### Step 4: Testing & Training

We verify:
- All detectors alarm when one is triggered
- Proper sound levels (85 dB minimum)
- Battery backup functions
- Silence/test buttons work
- Demonstrate testing procedure to homeowner
