faqs:
  - question: "Can I move the electrical panel in my condo?"
    answer: "Usually, no. In most high-rise buildings, the main electrical feed usually runs through a common variance (conduit riser). You generally must keep the panel location fixed, though you can upgrade the internals."
  - question: "Do I need a permit to change light fixtures in a condo?"
    answer: "For simple swaps like-for-like, often no. But for adding new recessed lighting (can lights), moving switches, or upgrading the panel, a City of Miami permit is absolutely required."
  - question: "What are 'Chicago Plenum' requirements?"
    answer: "Many high-rises in South Florida require specific cabling (MC cable or conduit) rather than standard Romex because the ceiling space is used for air circulation. Your electrician must know these fire codes."

# High-Rise Living, High-Tech Power

Living in **Brickell**, **Downtown**, or **Edgewater** offers incredible views, but renovating these units comes with a unique set of electrical challenges. Unlike a single-family home where you have access to the attic, condo electrical work requires navigating concrete ceilings, steel studs, and strict HOA rules.

Whether you are remodeling a vintage unit or upgrading a developer-standard apartment, your electrical plan needs to be precise.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Condo Electrical FAQ

### Can I move the electrical panel in my condo?
**Usually, no.** In most high-rise buildings, the main electrical feed comes from a central "busway" or riser. You generally must keep the panel location fixed, though you can upgrade the internals to handle more power or safer breakers.

### Do I need a permit to change light fixtures?
**It depends.** For simple swaps (taking down a chandelier, putting up a fan), often no. But for **adding new recessed lighting**, moving switches, or adding outlets, a City of Miami permit is mandatory.

### What is "Chicago Plenum" or MC Cable?
Many high-rises use the space above the ceiling for air return ("plenum"). This means we cannot use standard plastic-sheathed wire (Romex) because toxic fumes would spread in a fire. We must use **metal-clad (MC) cable** or conduit.

## Top 3 Electrical Upgrades for Miami Condos

### 1. Smart Lighting & Automated Shades
In a condo with floor-to-ceiling glass, managing light and heat is crucial.
- **Lutron Caséta / RA3:** Replace standard switches with smart dimmers. Control entire scenes ("Movie Night", "Sunset") from your phone.
- **Motorized Shades:** Hard-wiring power for shades is far superior to battery packs. We run low-voltage wiring discreetly along window headers.

### 2. Panel Upgrades for Modern Loads
Developer panels are often "contractor grade."
- **Surge Protection:** Essential in high-rises to protect your expensive electronics from building-wide issues.
- **AFCI Breakers:** Code compliance for bedroom and living area circuits.

### 3. LED Recessed Lighting (The "No-Can" Can)
Concrete ceilings make traditional "can" lights impossible without dropping the ceiling height.
- **The Solution:** Ultra-thin LED wafers. These require less than 1 inch of clearance and can sometimes be installed in very shallow furr-downs.
