faqs:
  - question: "Do I need a special charger for my Tesla, or can I use a universal charger?"
    answer: "Tesla vehicles can use both Tesla-specific Wall Connectors and universal Level 2 chargers with a J1772 adapter (included with all Teslas). Universal chargers work with all EVs including Teslas, making them a good choice if you might own different EV brands in the future. We install both Tesla Wall Connectors and universal brands like ChargePoint, JuiceBox, and Grizzl-E."
  - question: "Does my electrical panel have enough capacity for an EV charger?"
    answer: "Most Level 2 EV chargers require a dedicated 40-50 amp circuit. If your home has a 100-amp panel that's nearly full, you'll likely need a panel upgrade to 200 amps. We perform a load calculation to determine if your panel can safely support EV charging plus your existing electrical demands. Many Miami homes built before 2000 need panel upgrades for EV chargers."
  - question: "How long does EV charger installation take?"
    answer: "Installation typically takes 3-6 hours for a standard setup where the charger is within 25 feet of the panel. Longer runs, panel upgrades, or complex routing add time. Most homes are completed in one day. We handle permits, installation, and final inspection—you'll be charging your EV by evening."
  - question: "Do I need a permit to install an EV charger in Miami?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Miami-Dade and Broward counties require electrical permits for EV charger installations. We pull all permits, coordinate inspections, and ensure code compliance. Permits typically cost $150-300 and are required for insurance and code compliance. Never hire an electrician who suggests skipping permits."
  - question: "Should I install the charger in my garage or outside?"
    answer: "Either works. Indoor garage installation is most common in Miami—protected from weather and more secure. Outdoor installation requires a weather-resistant (NEMA 3R) charger or enclosure. We install proper weatherproofing, mounting on exterior walls with appropriate cable management. Many South Florida homes have carports or outdoor parking that work well with weatherproof chargers."
  - question: "What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 charging?"
    answer: "Level 1 uses a standard 120V outlet and charges slowly (3-5 miles of range per hour). Level 2 uses a dedicated 240V circuit and charges much faster (25-40 miles of range per hour). For daily use, Level 2 is essential—you'll fully charge overnight. Level 1 is only practical for plug-in hybrids or emergency backup charging."

## Charge at Home, Wake Up Ready

You bought an electric vehicle for the convenience, the savings, and the future. But if you're still relying on public charging stations or that painfully slow 120V outlet in your garage, you're missing the biggest benefit of EV ownership: **waking up every morning with a full charge**.

Installing a Level 2 home charging station transforms EV ownership from a minor inconvenience into seamless transportation. Pull into your garage at 6 PM with 30% battery. Wake up at 7 AM with 100%.

Here's everything Miami EV owners need to know about home charging installation.

## Quick Answers: EV Charger Installation FAQ

### Can any electrician install an EV charger?

**Technically yes, but experience matters.** EV charger installation requires:
- Proper load calculation (ensuring panel capacity)
- Heavy-duty 240V circuit installation
- Correct wire sizing for amperage and distance
- GFCI or CCID protection (code requirement for EV charging)
- Proper mounting and cable management
- Understanding of NEC Article 625 (Electric Vehicle Charging)

We've installed hundreds of EV chargers throughout Miami—from Tesla Wall Connectors in Coral Gables garages to universal chargers in Brickell condo parking spots.

### Do I need to upgrade my panel?

**Maybe.** It depends on:
- Your current panel size (100A, 150A, 200A)
- How much of that capacity is already used
- What other large loads you have (AC, pool, electric range)

**Rule of thumb**: Most homes with 100-amp panels need upgrades. Most homes with 200-amp panels do not, unless heavily loaded.

We perform free load calculations to determine if upgrade is needed.

### How fast will my EV charge at home?

**With Level 2 (240V)**:
- **40-amp charger**: ~9.6 kW →approximately 30-40 miles of range per hour
- **50-amp charger**: ~11.5 kW → approximately 35-45 miles of range per hour
- **60-amp charger**: ~14.4 kW → approximately 40-50 miles of range per hour

Most EVs charge fully overnight (8 hours) on a 40-amp charger.

**With Level 1 (120V)**: 3-5 miles per hour—impractical for daily use.

## Understanding Level 2 EV Charging

### Why You Need 240V

Your EV's battery is large—typically 60-100 kWh. A standard 120V outlet provides about 1.4 kW of charging power. At that rate, a completely dead 75 kWh battery takes over 50 hours to fully charge.

**Level 2 charging uses 240V** (the same voltage as your electric dryer or range) and provides 7-12 kW—charging the same battery in 6-10 hours.

This is why every EV manufacturer recommends Level 2 home charging.

### Charger Types: Hardwired vs. Plug-In

**Hardwired Chargers**:
- Connected directly to circuit (no outlet)
- Slightly less expensive installation
- Can't be moved easily
- Common for Tesla Wall Connectors

**Plug-In Chargers (NEMA 14-50 outlet)**:
- Plug into dedicated 50-amp outlet
- Can unplug and take with you if you move
- Slightly more installation cost
- More flexible

Either works. We install both depending on your preference.

### Tesla vs. Universal Chargers

**Tesla Wall Connector**:
- Sleek design, Tesla-branded
- Works exclusively with Tesla vehicles (unless using adapter)
- WiFi connectivity for monitoring
- 48-amp max output
- $400-500 for hardware

**Universal J1772 Chargers** (ChargePoint, JuiceBox, Grizzl-E, ClipperCreek):
- Works with ALL electric vehicles including Tesla (with included adapter)
- Various features: WiFi, scheduling, load management
- 32-50 amp options
- $300-800 for hardware

**Our recommendation**: If you'll only ever charge Teslas, the Wall Connector is excellent. If you might own a non-Tesla someday, go universal.

## Special Considerations for Miami EV Charging

### South Florida Weather

Your charger faces:
- **Humidity**: Year-round moisture requires weatherproof equipment
- **Heat**: Chargers mounted in direct sun get hot—we specify heat-tolerant models
- **Hurricanes**: Proper mounting withstands high winds
- **Salt Air**: Coastal homes need corrosion-resistant hardware

We install chargers rated for tropical environments.

### Condo & HOA Installations

Installing EV chargers in condos requires:
- HOA approval (often requires board vote)
- Certificate of Insurance submission
- Coordination with building management
- Sometimes electrical submetering
- Dedicated condo panel circuits

We handle condo installations throughout Brickell, Downtown, and Miami Beach—we know the process.

### Older Homes With 100-Amp Panels

Most Miami homes built before 2000 have 100-amp panels. Adding an EV charger often requires:
- Panel upgrade to 200 amps
- FPL service upgrade coordination
- New meter base
- Building permit for panel change

We bundle EV charger installation with panel upgrades for one-day completion.

## Common EV Charger Questions

**Q: Can I use an extension cord with my EV charger?**  
A: Never. Extension cords aren't rated for continuous high-amperage loads. They overheat and create fire hazards. Your charger must connect to a permanent dedicated circuit.

**Q: Will solar panels work with my EV charger?**  
A: Yes. Solar-generated power charges your EV just like grid power. Many South Florida EV owners pair solar panels with home charging—effectively creating free fueling forever.

**Q: Can I install multiple EV chargers?**  
A: Yes. Each requires a dedicated circuit (40-50 amps). Two chargers = 80-100 amps additional load. Most homes need panel upgrades for multiple chargers.

**Q: Do EV chargers work during power outages?**  
A: No, unless connected to a backup generator or solar + battery storage. The charger needs power to operate.
