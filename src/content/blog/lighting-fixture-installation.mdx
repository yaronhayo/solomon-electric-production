faqs:
  - question: "Can you install a heavy chandelier in my high ceiling?"
    answer: "Yes. Heavy chandeliers require specialized installation with proper junction box support rated for the weight, secure mounting to ceiling joists or support beams, and sometimes ceiling reinforcement. We use rated ceiling boxes (typically 50-150 lb capacity), ensure secure mounting, and provide proper wire support for large fixtures."
  - question: "How many recessed lights should I install in a room?"
    answer: "It depends on room size, ceiling height, and purpose. General rule: one recessed light per 25-30 square feet for general lighting. Kitchens need task lighting over work areas. We design lighting layouts that provide proper illumination levels, prevent dark spots, and create the ambiance you want."
  - question: "Do I need a permit to install light fixtures in Miami?"
    answer: "Simple fixture swaps (replacing existing fixtures like-for-like) typically don't require permits. However, adding new recessed lighting, moving switch locations, adding circuits, or installing outdoor lighting does require electrical permits in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. We handle all permit requirements."
  - question: "Can you install dimmer switches with my new lights?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We install dimmer switches compatible with your lighting type—LED, CFL, or incandescent. LED fixtures require LED-rated dimmers; using standard dimmers causes flickering and buzzing. We match dimmers to your specific fixtures for flicker-free dimming throughout the range."
  - question: "What's the difference between can lights and wafer lights?"
    answer: "Traditional can lights (recessed cans) are 6-7 inches deep and require significant ceiling cavity space. Wafer lights are ultra-thin LED fixtures (less than 1 inch) that install in minimal spaces—perfect for concrete ceilings, shallow soffits, or when you can't fit traditional cans. Both provide similar light quality."
  - question: "How do you install outdoor lighting that withstands Florida weather?"
    answer: "Outdoor lighting in South Florida requires weather-resistant fixtures (wet-rated or damp-rated), proper sealing of all connections, corrosion-resistant hardware, and often conduit protection for wiring. We use fixtures rated for tropical climates, seal all penetrations against moisture, and ensure proper GFCI protection for safety."

# Let There Be (Beautiful, Professional) Light

You've chosen the perfect chandelier for your dining room. It's stunning—and it weighs 60 pounds. Your ceiling is 12 feet high. And you're wondering if that existing junction box can support it.

**Spoiler: It probably can't.**

Professional lighting installation isn't just about connecting wires. It's about structural support, proper circuit sizing, code-compliant boxes, and creating the lighting design that transforms your space. Here's what Miami homeowners need to know.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Lighting Installation FAQ

### Can any electrician install my chandelier?

**Yes, but experience matters for complex installations.** Installing a 10-pound flush-mount fixture is straightforward. Installing a 75-pound crystal chandelier on a 14-foot ceiling requires:
- Ceiling reinforcement and rated junction box
- Proper lift equipment and support during installation
- Chain or cable tension calculation
- Understanding of weight distribution
- Sometimes two electricians for safety

We've installed hundreds of chandeliers throughout Miami—from Coral Gables mansions to Brickell penthouses.

### Why can't I just use the old ceiling box for my new chandelier?

**Most ceiling boxes are rated for 50 pounds maximum.** Your old light fixture probably weighed 5-10 pounds. Your new chandelier weighs 60+ pounds.

Installing a heavy fixture on an under-rated box creates a collapse hazard. The box pulls out of the ceiling, damaging drywall and potentially injuring people below.

**We install properly rated boxes**: 
- 50 lb boxes: Standard ceiling boxes
- 70 lb boxes: Heavy fixtures
- 150 lb boxes: Large chandeliers and ceiling fans

### How do you install recessed lighting in concrete ceilings?

**With specialized ultra-thin LED wafer lights.** Traditional recessed cans require 6-7 inches of ceiling cavity—impossible in concrete or shallow soffits.

**Wafer lights** are less than 1 inch thick and mount directly to the ceiling:
- Cut 4-6 inch hole in drywall/concrete
- Fish wire to location
- Connect wafer light
- Spring clips hold fixture in place

Perfect for Brickell condos and modern construction with concrete ceilings.

## Types of Lighting Installations We Perform

### Chandeliers & Large Pendant Lights

**Installation requirements**:
- Proper junction box support (rated for weight)
- Ceiling joist mounting or cross-bracing
- Height adjustment (chain/cable length)
- Dimmer switches (almost always desired)
- Sometimes lift equipment for high ceilings

**Common locations**:
- Dining rooms (centerpiece over table)
- Foyers (grand entrance lighting)
- Living rooms (statement lighting)
- Outdoor covered areas (covered patios, porches)

**Miami considerations**: Salt air near coast accelerates corrosion on metal fixtures. We recommend stainless steel or powder-coated fixtures for outdoor or near-ocean installations.

### Recessed Lighting (Can Lights)

**Popular applications**:
- Kitchens: Task lighting over counters, general illumination
- Living rooms: Even ambient lighting
- Bathrooms: Vanity task lighting, shower lighting
- Hallways: Streamlined illumination without fixtures protruding
- Closets: Focused lighting in tight spaces

**Our process**:
1. **Layout design**: Spacing for even light distribution (typically 4-6 feet apart)
2. **Circuit planning**: Lights grouped efficiently on circuits
3. **Cutting and wiring**: Precise holes, proper wire routing
4. **Installation**: Airtight IC-rated housings for energy efficiency
5. **Trim selection**: Baffle, reflector, or eyeball trims to match style

**IC-rated housings**: Required in Miami for recessed lights in insulated ceilings—prevents fire hazards and heat buildup.

### Pendant Lights

**Kitchen islands**: 
- Two or three pendants over island (popular)
- Height: 30-36 inches above counter surface
- Spacing: Evenly distributed or grouped artistically

**Dining areas**:
- Single large pendant or multiple smaller ones
- Centered over table
- Mounted on dimmer for ambiance control

**Bathrooms**:
- Pendant light or mini-chandelier over soaking tubs
- Wet-rated or damp-rated depending on location
- GFCI protection if within bathtub splash zone

### Under-Cabinet Lighting

**Kitchen applications**:
- **Puck lights**: Discrete circular fixtures (LED)
- **Light bars**: Continuous strip lighting (most popular)
- **Tape lighting**: Flexible LED strips for custom installations

**Installation**: 
- Hardwired to dedicated switch (cleanest look)
- Plug-in options available (less expensive, visible cord)
- Dimmer controls for task vs. ambient modes

### Outdoor Lighting

**Security & Safety**:
- Motion-sensor flood lights
- Entry door lighting (wall sconces, ceiling fixtures)
- Pathway lighting for steps and walkways
- Pool deck lighting (wet-rated, GFCI protected)

**Landscape Lighting**:
- Uplighting for trees and architectural features
- Path lights along walkways
- Well lights for ground-level uplighting
- Low-voltage landscape systems (12V or 24V)

**Installation requirements**:
- Weather-resistant fixtures (wet or damp rated)
- GFCI protection on all outdoor circuits
- Proper burial depth for underground wiring
- Corrosion-resistant hardware for coastal areas

## Lighting Design Principles for Miami Homes

### Layered Lighting Approach

**Layer 1: Ambient Lighting** (overall room illumination)
- Recessed lights
- Flush-mount or semi-flush ceiling fixtures
- Chandeliers

**Layer 2: Task Lighting** (focused work area lighting)
- Under-cabinet lights in kitchen
- Pendant lights over islands
- Vanity lights in bathrooms
- Reading lights in bedrooms

**Layer 3: Accent Lighting** (decorative, creates mood)
- Uplighting on walls or artwork
- Toe-kick lighting under cabinets
- Cove lighting in tray ceilings
- Statement chandeliers or pendants

**Best homes use all three layers** controlled independently with separate switches or dimmers.

### Light Temperature Selection

**Warm White (2700K-3000K)**:
- Creates cozy, inviting atmosphere
- Best for: Bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms
- Florida note: Balances cool white of daylight streaming through windows

**Neutral White (3500K-4000K)**:
- Clean, modern appearance
- Best for: Kitchens, bathrooms, offices
- Most versatile for mixed uses

**Cool White (5000K-6500K)**:
- Bright, energetic feel
- Best for: Garages, task lighting, security lighting
- Can feel sterile in living spaces

**Miami preference**: Most homeowners choose warm white (2700K-3000K) for main living spaces to counter the intense sunlight and create comfortable evening ambiance.

### Dimmer Control Strategy

**Always install dimmers on**:
- Dining room chandeliers
- Living room ambient lighting
- Master bedroom lighting
- Home theater/media room lighting

**Sometimes install dimmers on**:
- Kitchen recessed lighting (nice for evening ambiance)
- Bathroom vanity lights (customizable brightness)

**Never need dimmers on**:
- Closet lighting
- Garage lighting
- Exterior security/motion lights

## Specialty Installations

### High-Ceiling Chandelier Installation

**Challenges with 12-20 foot ceilings**:
- Scaffolding or lift equipment required
- Longer wire runs from switch to fixture
- Chain/cable length adjustment
- Installation weight and balance concerns

**Our approach**:
- Use proper lift equipment for safety
- Install additional support blocking at ceiling joist
- Ensure junction box is accessible (future maintenance)
- Provide proper chain/downrod length for visual proportion
- Test and adjust height before final securing

### Ceiling Fan/Light Combo Installation

**Requirements**:
- Fan-rated junction box (different from light-only boxes)
- Proper support to ceiling joists (fans vibrate)
- Correct downrod length for ceiling height (36-48 inches common)
- Wall control or remote (not just pull chains)

**Miami consideration**: Ceiling fans are near-essential. We install them to maximize air circulation while integrating lighting.

### Smart Lighting Integration

**Smart bulbs** (Philips Hue, LIFX):
- Easiest retrofit option
- Color-changing options
- Controlled via app or voice

**Smart switches** (Lutron Caséta, Leviton):
- Professional solution
- Keep existing bulbs
- Wall switch still works manually
- Integrates with whole-home automation

**We recommend smart switches for permanent installations**—more reliable than smart bulbs for chandeliers and recessed lighting.
