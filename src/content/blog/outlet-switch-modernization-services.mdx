faqs:
  - question: "Should I replace all my old two-prong outlets with three-prong?"
    answer: "Yes, for safety. Two-prong outlets lack grounding, which protects you from shocks and surges. However, simply replacing two-prong outlets with three-prong outlets without adding ground wires is illegal and dangerous. We either run new ground wires or install GFCI outlets (which don't require ground wires but provide protection) labeled 'No Equipment Ground.'"
  - question: "Where do I need GFCI outlets in my Miami home?"
    answer: "Florida code requires GFCI protection in bathrooms, kitchens (countertop outlets), garages, outdoors, crawl spaces, unfinished basements, laundry areas, and within 6 feet of sinks. We also recommend GFCIs in pool areas, workshops, and anywhere moisture is present. Modern homes have GFCI breakers or GFCI outlets protecting these circuits."
  - question: "Can you install USB outlets to charge phones and tablets?"
    answer: "Absolutely. USB outlets replace standard outlets and include USB-A or USB-C charging ports alongside regular AC receptacles. Popular in bedrooms, kitchens,offices, and anywhere you charge devices frequently. We install outlets with fast-charging USB-C ports (up to 20W) for modern devices."
  - question: "How do smart switches work and which brands do you install?"
    answer: "Smart switches replace standard light switches and connect to your WiFi, allowing control via smartphone apps or voice assistants (Alexa, Google Home, Siri). We install Lutron Caséta, Leviton, TP-Link Kasa, and other major brands. Smart switches work with your existing lights—no need for smart bulbs."
  - question: "My outlets are loose and won't hold plugs—can you fix that?"
    answer: "Yes. Loose outlets result from worn internal contacts or loose mounting. We replace worn outlets with new ones that grip plugs securely. Outlets should be replaced every 15-25 years even if they still work—internal contacts wear out and create poor connections that generate heat."
  - question: "Do I need a permit to replace outlets and switches in Miami?"
    answer: "Simple like-for-like replacement usually doesn't require permits. However, adding new outlets, moving outlet locations, upgrading electrical to add GFCI protection, or any work requiring new circuits does require permits. We handle all permit requirements for code-compliant installations."

# The Touch Points of Your Electrical System

You use them dozens of times a day. Flip switches. Plug in chargers. Run appliances. But when was the last time you actually looked at your outlets and switches?

If your home was built before 2000, those outlets and switches are at least 25 years old—and they're showing their age. Loose plugs. Discolored faces. Two-prong outlets without grounding. Missing GFCI protection where code now requires it.

**Here's how to modernize the touch points of your electrical system**—safely, stylishly, and up to current Florida code.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Outlet & Switch FAQ

### Can I just replace old outlets myself?

**No—and here's why Florida code requires licensed electricians**:

Even "simple" outlet replacement involves:
- Verifying proper wiring (hot, neutral, ground all correct)
- Ensuring wire connections are secure (torqued to spec)
- Confirming outlet boxes are properly secured
- Testing polarity and grounding
- Verifying GFCI protection where required
- Ensuring AFCI protection on bedroom/living circuits (newer code)

DIY outlet replacement is the #1 source of electrical fires from amateur installation. Loose connections create heat → heat creates fires.

### Why do my outlets only have two holes instead of three?

**Your home was built before grounding became standard (pre-1960s).** Two-prong outlets lack the ground pin that protects you from:
- Electrical shocks from faulty appliances
- Surges that damage electronics
- Ground faults that should trip protection

**The fix**: We either run new ground wires to outlets, or install GFCI outlets that provide shock protection without grounds (labeled "No Equipment Ground").

### What's the difference between GFCI outlets and regular outlets?

**GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets**:
- Detect ground faults (current leaking to ground)
- Trip within 1/30th of a second
- Prevent deadly shocks from faulty appliances
- Required by code in wet areas

**Regular outlets**:
- No ground fault protection
- Rely on circuit breaker to trip (slower, higher shock risk)
- Fine for dry locations away from water

**You need GFCIs** in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, outdoors, and near water—it's code and it saves lives.

## Why Upgrade Your Outlets and Switches?

### Safety: The #1 Reason

**Worn outlets create fire hazards**:
- Loose connections generate heat
- Arcing at poor contacts ignites surrounding materials
- Damaged internal components fail to hold plugs securely
- Missing GFCI protection allows deadly shocks

**Signs your outlets need immediate replacement**:
- ⚠️ Warm or hot to touch
- ⚠️ Discolored or darkened faceplate
- ⚠️ Buzzing or crackling sounds
- ⚠️ Loose plugs that fall out
- ⚠️ Sparking when plugging in devices
- ⚠️ Two-prong outlets (no grounding)

### Convenience: Modern Features

**USB Outlets**: 
- Charge phones, tablets without bulky adapters
- Fast-charging USB-C ports (20W)
- Free up AC outlet space

**Smart Switches**:
- Control lights from phone or voice
- Set schedules and timers
- Create scenes ("Goodnight" turns off all lights)

 **Weather-Resistant Outlets**:
- Required outdoors in Florida's wet climate
- Sealed design prevents moisture intrusion
- Spring-loaded covers protect from rain

### Code Compliance: Required Upgrades

**Florida electrical code now requires**:
- GFCI protection in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, outdoors
- AFCI protection in bedrooms and living areas (newer construction/major renovations)
- Tamper-resistant outlets in new residential construction
- Weather-resistant outdoor outlets

If your home predates these requirements, upgrading brings you to current code—important for insurance and safety.
