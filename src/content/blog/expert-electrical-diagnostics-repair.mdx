faqs:
  - question: "Why do my lights flicker when the AC kicks on?"
    answer: "Flickering lights when AC starts indicate undersized wiring, loose connections at panel or service entrance, or insufficient electrical service capacity. AC units draw heavy startup current—if your main service or circuit wiring can't handle the surge, voltage drops cause lights to dim. We diagnose the specific cause and recommend proper solutions."
  - question: "How do you diagnose electrical problems without tearing apart walls?"
    answer: "We use specialized diagnostic tools: multimeters measure voltage/current/resistance, circuit tracers identify wire paths, thermal imaging cameras detect hot spots, clamp meters measure circuit loads, and outlet testers verify proper wiring. These tools let us pinpoint problems without destructive exploration in most cases."
  - question: "Why does one outlet not work while others on the same circuit do?"
    answer: "Common causes: GFCI outlet upstream has tripped (resetting it restores power), loose wire connection at the dead outlet, backstab connection failure, or damaged outlet internal components. We trace the circuit, test connections, and identify the exact failure point for targeted repair."
  - question: "Can you find the source of burning smells from electrical?"
    answer: "Yes, and this requires immediate attention. Burning smells indicate overheating—from loose connections, overloaded circuits, failing breakers, or deteriorating wire insulation. We use thermal imaging to detect hot spots, inspect all connections, measure circuit loads, and identify the dangerous condition before it causes fire."
  - question: "Why does my breaker trip randomly with nothing plugged in?"
    answer: "Random breaker trips with no load indicate failing breakers, ground faults in wiring, moisture in junction boxes, damaged wire insulation somewhere in the circuit, or AFCI breakers detecting arc faults. We systematically test the breaker, inspect the circuit, and isolate the problem."
  - question: "How much does electrical troubleshooting cost?"
    answer: "Diagnostic fees vary by problem complexity. Simple outlet issues may take 30 minutes; complex intermittent problems can require hours of testing and investigation. We provide upfront diagnostic rates and explain findings before proceeding with repairs. Most diagnostics complete within 1-2 hours."

# Finding Needles in Electrical Haystacks

Your lights flicker randomly. One outlet doesn't work. A breaker trips for no apparent reason. You've reset it four times today.

**Something's wrong, but what?**

Amateur troubleshooting wastes time and money—replacing random parts hoping one fixes it. Professional electrical diagnostics use systematic testing, specialized equipment, and expert knowledge to **find the actual problem**.

Here's how we diagnose electrical issues throughout Miami.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Diagnostics FAQ

### Can't I just replace the breaker/outlet/switch and see if that fixes it?

**Bad approach.** Replacing parts randomly:
- Wastes money on unnecessary components
- May not fix the problem (symptom vs. root cause)
- Can miss dangerous underlying conditions
- Often makes diagnosis harder later

**Example**: Breaker keeps tripping → You replace breaker → Still trips → Problem was overloaded circuit or short in wiring, not the breaker.

### What tools do professional electricians use for diagnostics?

**Our diagnostic equipment**:
- Multimeters (voltage, current, resistance, continuity)
- Clamp meters (measure current without breaking circuit)
- Circuit tracers (find wire paths in walls)
- Thermal imaging cameras (detect hot spots)
- Outlet testers (verify proper wiring)
- Ground fault testers
- Load meters (measure circuit demand)

### How long does electrical troubleshooting take?

**Depends on problem complexity**:
- Simple issues (bad outlet, tripped GFCI): 15-30 minutes
- Moderate problems (circuit tracing, connection issues): 30-90 minutes
- Complex intermittent issues: 1-3 hours or more

We explain findings and get approval before extensive diagnostic work.

## Common Electrical Problems We Diagnose

### Flickering or Dimming Lights

**Possible causes**:
- Loose wire connections at fixtures, switches, or panel
- Undersized circuit wire for load
- Poor connections at service entrance
- Failing electrical utility transformer
- Loose neutral at panel or meter

**Our diagnostic process**:
1. Determine if problem affects one fixture, one circuit, or whole house
2. Test voltage at multiple points
3. Inspect panel connections
4. Check service entrance connections
5. Use thermal imaging to detect loose connections

### Intermittent Power Loss

**Frustrating intermittent problems**:
- Power loss that comes and goes
- Outlets that work sometimes
- Circuits that fail randomly then restore

**Diagnostic approach**:
- Test under load conditions
- Monitor voltage over time
- Wiggle test connections
- Thermal imaging during operation
- Systematic isolation of circuit segments

### Breakers That Keep Tripping

**Why breakers trip**:
- Overloaded circuit (too many devices)
- Short circuit (hot wire touching ground/neutral)
- Ground fault (current leaking to ground)
- Failing breaker
- AFCI detecting arc faults

**We determine which** through systematic testing and load measurement.

### Dead Outlets or Switches

**Systematic diagnosis**:
1. Test for power at outlet with multimeter
2. Check upstream GFCI outlets (may control downstream outlets)
3. Verify circuit breaker on
4. Test connections at outlet box
5. Trace circuit if no power found

### Burning Smells or Hot Outlets

**CRITICAL—requires immediate diagnosis**:
- Thermal imaging identifies hot spots
- Inspect all connections tightly
- Measure circuit load vs. capacity
- Check wire gauge appropriateness
- Identify overheating components

**Burning smells = fire hazard**—never ignore.

## Diagnostic Tools & Techniques

### Multimeter Testing

**What we measure**:
- **Voltage**: Should be 120V (±5%) for standard circuits, 240V for large appliances
- **Current**: Verifies circuit load, identifies shorts
- **Resistance**: Tests continuity, finds broken wires
- **Continuity**: Verifies complete circuit path

### Thermal Imaging

**Infrared cameras detect**:
- Hot connections (loose terminals)
- Overloaded wires
- Failing breakers
- Panel problems
- Hidden issues behind walls

**Temperature differences** reveal electrical problems invisible to naked eye.

### Circuit Tracing

**Finding wires in walls**:
- Plug tracer transmitter into outlet
- Use receiver to follow wire path
- Identify which outlets on same circuit
- Locate junction boxes
- Find where wires route through structure

### Load Testing

**Measuring actual circuit demand**:
- Clamp meter measures amps on circuit
- Compare to circuit breaker rating
- Identify overload conditions
- Determine if circuits need upgrading

## Miami-Specific Electrical Issues

### Corrosion from Humidity

**South Florida's humid climate causes **:
- Corroded panel connections
- Oxidized wire splices
- Deteriorated outdoor connections
- Failed waterproofing

**We check**: All exterior connections, panel components for rust/corrosion, outdoor boxes for moisture intrusion.

### Lightning Surge Damage

**Storm damage diagnosis**:
- Test panel for surge damage
- Check GFCI/ AFCI functionality post-storm
- Inspect service entrance components
- Test outlets for proper operation
- Verify appliance and electronics

### Aluminum Wiring Issues

**Homes built 1965-1973**:
- Aluminum wire expands/contracts more than copper
- Connections loosen over time
- Creates fire hazards at outlets/switches

**We identify**: Aluminum wiring, inspect all connections, recommend AlumiConn repairs or copper pigtails.

- Ground fault testing

### Step 4: Isolation & Identification

**Narrow down the problem**:
- Test individual circuit segments
- Disconnect loads systematically
- Identify specific failure point
- Determine root cause

### Step 5: Solution Recommendation

**Explain findings and options**:
- What's wrong (root cause)
- Why it happened
- Repair options
- Cost estimates
