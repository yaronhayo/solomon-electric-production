faqs:
  - question: "How do I know if my Miami home needs a panel upgrade?"
    answer: "Signs include frequently tripping breakers, dimming lights when appliances run, a panel older than 25 years, Federal Pacific or Zinsco branding, inability to add circuits, or planning to install an EV charger or pool. Most Miami homes built before 2000 have 100-amp panels that can't handle today's electrical demands."
  - question: "How long does a panel upgrade take in Miami?"
    answer: "Most residential panel upgrades are completed in one day (6-8 hours). This includes FPL disconnecting power in the morning, our installation, building department inspection, and FPL reconnecting service—typically the same day in Miami-Dade and Broward counties."
  - question: "Do I need a permit to upgrade my electrical panel in Miami?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Miami-Dade and Broward counties require permits for panel upgrades. We handle all permit applications, coordinate FPL service upgrades, schedule inspections, and ensure full code compliance. Never hire an electrician who suggests skipping permits."
  - question: "What's wrong with Federal Pacific and Zinsco panels?"
    answer: "Federal Pacific and Zinsco panels have documented failure rates where breakers don't trip during overcurrent conditions—the exact moment they should protect your home. While not officially recalled, they're widely recognized fire hazards. Many insurance companies require replacement regardless of age."
  - question: "Will upgrading my panel increase my electric bill?"
    answer: "No. A larger panel provides more capacity but doesn't use more electricity. Your bill is based on consumption, not panel size. Many homeowners see slight savings because properly sized panels eliminate inefficiencies from overloaded circuits."
  - question: "Can I upgrade just the breakers without replacing the panel?"
    answer: "It depends. If your panel box is in good condition and from a reputable manufacturer, we can sometimes upgrade individual breakers to AFCI or GFCI versions. However, if you need more capacity (100A to 200A) or have a hazardous brand, full panel replacement is necessary."

# The Power Hub That Protects Everything

Your electrical panel sits quietly in the garage or utility room, but it's arguably the most critical safety device in your home. In South Florida, where air conditioning runs nearly year-round, home offices are standard, and electric vehicles are becoming commonplace, that panel is working harder than ever.

If your home was built before 2000, there's a strong chance your electrical panel can't safely handle modern electrical demands—and that's a problem that goes beyond inconvenience.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Panel Upgrade FAQ

### How do I know if my Miami home needs a panel upgrade?

Signs are clear if you know what to look for: breakers that trip when you run multiple appliances, lights that dim when the AC kicks on, or a panel that's visibly corroded from Florida's humid climate. **If your panel is labeled Federal Pacific or Zinsco, it's a fire hazard regardless of age.**

Most critically, if you're planning to add an [EV charger](/services/level-2-ev-charger-installation) (requires 40-50 amps), a pool pump, or remodeling your kitchen, your existing 100-amp panel likely doesn't have the capacity.

### How long does a panel upgrade take?

**One day, start to finish.** Here's the typical Miami-Dade timeline:
- Morning: FPL disconnects power
- Midday: We install your new panel (4-6 hours)
- Afternoon: Building inspector approves the work
- Late afternoon: FPL reconnects service

You'll be without power for 6-8 hours total. We coordinate everything with FPL and the building department.

### Do I need a permit in Miami-Dade County?

**Always.** Panel changes legally require permits whether you're in Miami, Coral Gables, Hialeah, or anywhere in Miami-Dade and Broward. We handle the entire permit process, which includes:
- Submitting plans to the building department
- Coordinating FPL service upgrade approval
- Scheduling the required inspection
- Providing you with all signed-off documentation

Permits aren't optional red tape—they ensure your installation meets life-safety codes and protects your insurance coverage.

## Why South Florida Homes Are Upgrading Now

### The 100-Amp Era Is Over

Most South Florida homes built between 1970-2000 came with 100-amp electrical service. That was adequate for the time—central AC, a few appliances, maybe a pool pump.

Today's electrical reality is different:
- **Central AC**: 40-60 amps (continuous load)
- **Electric Range**: 40-50 amps
- **EV Charger**: 40-50 amps
- **Pool Equipment**: 20-30 amps
- **Home Office**: 15-20 amps
- **Gaming/Entertainment Systems**: 10-15 amps

Do the math. A 100-amp panel can't safely handle all of this simultaneously. When you exceed 80% of panel capacity (the NEC safety limit), you're in dangerous territory.

### The Federal Pacific Problem

If your panel has "FPE" or "Federal Pacific" anywhere on it, you have a documented fire hazard. These panels, installed in millions of homes between the 1950s-1980s, have a failure rate where breakers **don't trip when they should**.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission investigated multiple house fires linked to Federal Pacific panels. While never officially recalled, electricians know: t**These panels must be replaced.** Federal Pacific panels were installed in millions of homes nationwide. In South Florida's humid climate, the corrosion problem is even worse. Our [panel replacement service](/services/service-panel-replacement) handles these hazardous panels safely.

Zinsco panels have similar documented issues. Aluminum bus bars and poor breaker contact create the same failure-to-trip problem.

### Insurance Companies Are Paying Attention

Many insurance companies now:
- Require panels older than 30 years to be inspected before coverage
- Refuse coverage for Federal Pacific and Zinsco panels
- Offer premium discounts for upgraded 200-amp panels with whole-home surge protection

If you're buying or selling a home in Miami, panel condition is increasingly part of negotiations. Consider scheduling a [comprehensive electrical safety inspection](/services/electrical-safety-inspection) before listing.

## What a Professional Panel Upgrade Includes

### 1. Load Calculation Analysis

We don't guess. We calculate your home's actual electrical load:
- Existing circuits and appliances
- Planned additions (EV charger, pool, remodel)
- Future capacity needs
- FPL service requirements

This determines whether you need 200A service, or in some cases, 400A for larger homes with multiple AC units and heavy electrical demands.

### 2. FPL Service Coordination

Upgrading your panel means upgrading your service drop from FPL. We handle:
- FPL application for service upgrade
- Scheduling power disconnection/reconnection
- New meter base installation
- Weather head and service cable upgrades if needed

In Miami-Dade, FPL typically requires 5-7 business days' notice. In Broward, it varies by specific FPL district.

### 3. Modern Panel Installation

Your new panel includes:
- **200-amp main breaker** (or higher as needed)
- **AFCI breakers** for bedrooms and living areas (code requirement)
- **GFCI breakers** for bathrooms, kitchen, garage, outdoor circuits
- **Copper bus bars** (not aluminum)
- **Whole-home surge protection** (highly recommended)
- **Proper labeling** for every circuit

We install Square D, Eaton, or Siemens panels—all reputable manufacturers with UL listings and proven track records.

### 4. Hurricane-Ready Installations

In South Florida, your panel needs extra protection:
- **Weatherproof enclosures** for outdoor panels
- **Corrosion-resistant hardware** (stainless steel)
- **Proper sealing** against moisture intrusion
- **Elevated mounting** in flood-prone areas (per Miami-Dade 2020 Building Code)
