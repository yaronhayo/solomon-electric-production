faqs:
  - question: "How deep does underground electrical conduit need to be buried in Florida?"
    answer: "Burial depth depends on conduit type and voltage: rigid metal conduit (RMC) or IMC requires 6 inches minimum; PVC conduit under driveways needs 18 inches; PVC conduit in landscaping needs 12-18 inches; direct-burial cable (UF) needs 12-24 inches. We follow NEC and Miami-Dade code for proper burial depths ensuring protection and code compliance."
  - question: "Can you run electrical underground to a detached garage or shed?"
    answer: "Yes. We trench from main panel to structure, install proper conduit at code-required depth, pull appropriate wire gauge for distance and load, install sub-panel or outlets in structure, and coordinate inspections. Detached structures typically need 50-100 amp circuits depending on planned use (garage door openers, tools, lighting, outlets)."
  - question: "What type of conduit is best for underground pool electrical?"
    answer: "We use schedule 40 or schedule 80 PVC conduit for pool electrical—corrosion-resistant, durable, and meets code requirements. Pool electrical requires rigid conduit (not flexible), proper sizing for wire gauge, waterproof connections, and bonding to pool structure. Never use EMT or flexible conduit underground—not rated for burial or moisture."
  - question: "How do you protect underground electrical from landscaping damage?"
    answer: "We install warning tape 6-12 inches above buried conduit, mark locations on property drawings, use tracer wire in PVC conduit for future locating, route around high-traffic areas, and provide homeowners with buried utility maps. We also recommend calling 811 (Sunshine State One-Call) before any digging."
  - question: "Can you install underground electrical for landscape lighting?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Most landscape lighting uses 12V or 24V low-voltage systems (safer and more efficient). We install properly sized transformers, bury low-voltage cable at appropriate depth, make waterproof connections, and position fixtures for optimal lighting effect. Low-voltage systems are ideal for path lighting, uplighting trees, and accent lighting."
  - question: "What's different about installing underground electrical in Florida's sandy soil?"
    answer: "Sandy South Florida soil requires special considerations: conduit can shift during heavy rains, sand provides poor tamping/support, salt content accelerates corrosion near coast, and high water tables affect burial depth. We use concrete encasement for stability in some areas, proper bedding material, corrosion-resistant materials, and sometimes install above flood levels."

# Power Where You Need It—Without Overhead Wires

Your pool needs electrical. Your detached garage workshop needs power. Your landscape lighting needs underground feeds.

**You don't want ugly overhead wires crisscrossing your property.**

Underground electrical provides clean aesthetics while protecting wiring from weather, impacts, and UV degradation. But installation requires specialized knowledge—improper burial depth, wrong conduit type, or poor waterproofing leads to failures, safety hazards, and expensive repairs.

Here's how professional underground electrical installation works in South Florida.

## ⚡ Quick Answers: Underground Electrical FAQ

### Can I just bury regular wire in the ground?

**No—absolutely not.** Standard Romex (NM cable) degrades rapidly when buried. You need:
- **Direct-burial cable (UF)**: Moisture-resistant insulation rated for burial
- **Or wire in conduit**: THHN/THWN wire inside proper conduit

**Using wrong wire** leads to insulation failure, shorts, and dangerous conditions.

### How do I find buried electrical years later?

**Professional installations include**:
- Detailed property drawings showing burial paths
- Warning tape buried 6-12 inches above conduit
- Tracer wire in PVC conduit (locatable with detector)
- Markers at entry/exit points

**Before digging, always call 811** (Sunshine State One-Call) for professional utility locating.

### What's the difference between PVC and metal conduit underground?

**PVC (Schedule 40/80)**:
- Corrosion-proof (ideal for Florida)
- Lighter and easier to install
- Less expensive
- Requires deeper burial than metal
- Needs tracer wire for future locating

**Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC/IMC)**:
- Extremely durable
- Shallower burial allowed
- More expensive
- Can corrode in salty coastal soil

**We recommend PVC for most South Florida underground installations.**

## Common Underground Electrical Applications

### Pool & Spa Electrical

**Pool equipment requires**:
- Pump circuits (usually 20-30 amps, 240V)
- Heater circuits (if electric, 40-50 amps)
- Pool automation systems
- Underwater lighting (12V low-voltage)
- GFCI protection on all circuits

**Bonding requirements**:
- All metal pool components bonded
- Equipotential bonding grid
- Proper grounding to panel

**We handle**: Complete pool electrical from panel to equipment, all bonding, underwater lighting, and inspection coordination.

### Detached Garage/Workshop Power

**Running power to structures**:
- Trench from main panel to structure
- Install sub-panel in structure (typically 50-100A)
- Pull proper wire gauge for distance (voltage drop considerations)
- Provide circuits for garage door, outlets, lighting, tools

**Special considerations**:
- Long runs need larger wire (voltage drop)
- Sub-panel needs separate ground rod
- GFCI requirements for garage outlets

### Landscape & Exterior Lighting

**Low-voltage landscape lighting (12V/24V)**:
- Install transformer near power source
- Bury low-voltage cable (direct burial at 6 inches)
- Make waterproof connections
- Position fixtures for lighting design

**Line-voltage landscape lighting (120V)**:
- Requires conduit and GFCI protection
- Deeper burial requirements
- More complex installation
- Higher operating costs

**Low-voltage preferred** for energy efficiency and safety.

### Outdoor Kitchen & Entertainment Areas

**Power for outdoor living**:
- Dedicated circuits for refrigerators, freezers
- GFCI outlets for small appliances
- Circuits for outdoor TVs, speakers
- Lighting circuits
- Sometimes natural gas ignition (if applicable)

## Underground Installation Process

### Step 1: Planning & Permitting

**Pre-installation**:
- Call 811 for utility locating
- Design route avoiding obstacles
- Calculate wire size for load and distance
- Determine burial depth requirements
- Submit permit applications

### Step 2: Trenching

**Dig trench to proper depth**:
- Machine trenching for long runs
- Hand digging near existing utilities
- Proper slope for water drainage
- Remove rocks and debris

**Typical depths (Miami-Dade)**:
- PVC conduit (landscape): 12-18 inches
- PVC conduit (under driveways): 18-24 inches
- Direct-burial cable: 12-24 inches
- RMC/IMC: 6 inches minimum

### Step 3: Conduit Installation

**Install conduit properly**:
- Use sweeps (not elbows) for wire pulling ease
- Support conduit on bedding material
- Connect sections with proper fittings
- Install pull string for wire pulling
- Add tracer wire alongside conduit

### Step 4: Wire Pulling

**Pull wire through conduit**:
- Use proper gauge for load and distance
- Apply wire-pulling lubricant
- Avoid damaging wire insulation
- Leave service loops at both ends
- Label wires clearly

### Step 5: Backfilling & Protection

**Proper backfill process**:
- Place warning tape 6-12 inches above conduit
- Use sand or fine soil immediately around conduit
- Tamp in layers to prevent settling
- Mark locations on site plan
- Restore landscape

### Step 6: Connections & Testing

**Final electrical work**:
- Make watertight connections
- Ground and bond properly
- Test continuity and insulation
- Verify voltage at endpoints
- Schedule inspection

## Miami-Specific Underground Considerations

### High Water Tables

**South Florida water tables**:
- Often 2-4 feet below surface
- Affects burial depth decisions
- May require conduit encasement
- Waterproof connections critical

### Salt Air & Coastal Corrosion

**Near-ocean installations**:
- Use PVC conduit (not metal)
- Stainless steel hardware
- Extra waterproofing
- Regular inspection schedule

### Hurricane & Storm Protection

**Storm-resistant installations**:
- Secure anchoring at entry/exit points
- Proper sealing prevents water intrusion
- Elevation considerations in flood zones
- Impact-resistant boxes above ground

### Sandy Soil Challenges

**Installation in sand**:
- Less stable than clay soil
- Conduit can shift during settlement
- Requires proper bedding material
- Sometimes concrete encasement needed
