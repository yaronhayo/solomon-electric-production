  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much will LED retrofit save my business?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on your current lighting type and operating hours. Converting fluorescent to LED typically saves 50% on lighting electricity. Converting HID (metal halide, high-pressure sodium) often saves 70-75%. We calculate projected savings specific to your facility during our audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the payback period for commercial LED retrofit?",
      "answer": "Most commercial LED conversions pay back in 2-4 years through energy and maintenance savings, often faster with utility rebates. After payback, savings continue for the life of the LEDs—typically 10+ years of pure savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to replace entire fixtures or just lamps?",
      "answer": "It depends on your existing fixtures. Many fluorescent fixtures can be retrofitted with LED tubes and modified ballasts (or ballast bypass). Older or damaged fixtures may warrant complete replacement with LED fixtures. We recommend the most cost-effective approach for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about utility rebates for LED conversion?",
      "answer": "FPL and other Florida utilities offer commercial lighting rebates that significantly reduce retrofit costs. Programs change periodically, but substantial incentives are typically available. We stay current on rebate programs and handle all documentation for your claim."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will LED lighting provide the same light levels?",
      "answer": "Properly designed LED retrofit matches or improves existing light levels. We use lighting design calculations to ensure adequate illumination. Often, newer LEDs actually improve light quality—better color rendering, no flicker, and more uniform distribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work around our business hours?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We understand business operations can't always stop for lighting work. We frequently install during evenings, weekends, or non-peak hours to minimize disruption. We'll work with your schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of commercial lighting can be converted?",
      "answer": "We retrofit all commercial lighting types: T12 and T8 fluorescent (most common), metal halide and HPS warehouse/parking lighting, halogen track and display lighting, CFL fixtures, and older outdoor lighting. Whatever you have, we can upgrade it to LED."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does commercial LED installation take?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends on facility size. A typical office or retail space can be converted in a day or two. Large warehouses or multi-building properties may take a week or more. We provide project timelines during the proposal phase."
