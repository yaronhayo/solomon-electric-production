    {
      "question": "How do I know if it's FPL's problem or mine?",
      "answer": "Check your neighbors\u2014if they're also out, it's likely FPL. If they have power but you don't, check your main breaker first. If the main breaker is on or won't reset, the problem is your electrical system. We can help diagnose either way."
    },
    {
      "question": "My main breaker tripped\u2014should I reset it?",
      "answer": "You can try resetting once. If it immediately trips again, don't keep trying\u2014repeated tripping can damage the breaker and indicates a fault that needs investigation. If it stays on after reset, monitor closely for any problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I only have power in half my house?",
      "answer": "Your home receives power on two 'legs' from the utility. If one leg fails (utility side) or you have a main panel problem, you'll have partial power. This needs professional diagnosis\u2014it could be FPL or your panel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help during a major storm outage?",
      "answer": "We prioritize storm damage repairs that enable FPL reconnection\u2014service entrance repairs, weather head replacement, and panel damage. If FPL is your issue, we can help with generator hookup until power returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can you respond to power emergencies?",
      "answer": "We prioritize power outage calls and typically respond within 60-90 minutes. During major storms or widespread outages, response may take longer as we work through calls in order."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my power outage is FPL's responsibility?",
      "answer": "We'll tell you if FPL needs to fix the problem and help you report the outage effectively. If you have generator needs while waiting for FPL, we can help with safe generator hookup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is partial power dangerous?",
      "answer": "Partial power itself isn't immediately dangerous, but it can indicate problems that could become serious. Appliances on working circuits are typically fine, but the underlying cause should be investigated promptly to prevent further issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why won't my GFCI reset after a power outage?",
      "answer": "GFCI outlets can fail during power surges or when exposed to moisture. If the TEST and RESET buttons don't work, the GFCI itself may be damaged and need replacement. Check that the outlet is receiving power first (it won't reset if the circuit is dead)."
