  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do my LED lights flicker with a dimmer switch?",
      "answer": "Not all dimmers work with all LED bulbs. Older dimmers designed for incandescent bulbs often can't handle the low wattage of LEDs. The solution is an LED-compatible dimmer matched to your specific bulbs. We install dimmers that work properly with your lighting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a 3-way switch and why is it different?",
      "answer": "A 3-way switch is one of two switches that control the same light from different locations (like top and bottom of stairs). They require special wiring with an extra 'traveler' wire connecting them. Replacing one 3-way switch with an incompatible type breaks the circuit. We handle these properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add a dimmer switch to any light?",
      "answer": "Almost any light can be dimmed with the right equipment. However, some LED fixtures have non-dimmable drivers, and ceiling fans should use fan-rated controllers (not standard dimmers). We verify your fixture is dimmable and install the appropriate switch."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's an occupancy sensor switch?",
      "answer": "Occupancy sensors automatically turn lights on when you enter a room and off when you leave—perfect for closets, laundry rooms, and bathrooms. They save energy and add convenience. We install motion-detecting and vacancy sensor switches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my switch buzz?",
      "answer": "Buzzing typically indicates a dimmer that's incompatible with your bulbs or a switch with failing internal contacts. For dimmers, the solution is usually a compatible switch and/or compatible bulbs. For standard switches, replacement is needed—buzzing indicates arcing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add a switch where there isn't one?",
      "answer": "Yes. We can add switches to control existing lights, add switches for 3-way control of lights currently controlled from one location only, and install new switch runs. This often requires running wire through walls, which we handle professionally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between single-pole and single-location switches?",
      "answer": "Single-pole switches are the standard type—one switch controls one light. Double-pole switches handle 240V circuits (rare in residential). 3-way switches work in pairs to control one light from two locations. We determine which type you need based on your wiring."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install timer switches?",
      "answer": "Yes. Timer switches are great for bathroom exhaust fans, outdoor lights, and holiday lighting. We install mechanical timers and digital programmable timers that can control lights on different schedules for different days."
