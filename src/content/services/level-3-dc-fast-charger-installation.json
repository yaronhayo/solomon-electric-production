  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much power does a DC fast charger need?",
      "answer": "DC fast chargers range from 50 kW to 350 kW. More power means faster charging. A 50 kW charger adds significant range per hour; a 350 kW charger can add substantial range in 10-15 minutes. Higher power requires larger electrical infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost difference between Level 2 and Level 3?",
      "answer": "Significant. Level 3 charging equipment is a major investment compared to Level 2\u2014the equipment is specialized and the electrical infrastructure requirements are much larger. However, the rapid charging capabilities and revenue potential are also significantly higher for high-traffic commercial sites."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my site need a service upgrade?",
      "answer": "Very likely. DC fast chargers require 50-350+ kW each\u2014far more than most commercial services can spare. Most DCFC installations include service upgrades. We assess current capacity and plan necessary upgrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take?",
      "answer": "Much longer than Level 2. Utility work for service upgrades can take 3-12 months depending on transformer and line work required. After electrical infrastructure is complete, charger installation takes weeks. Plan 6-18 months for complete DCFC projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What incentives exist for DC fast charging?",
      "answer": "Federal tax credits, FPL commercial EV programs, and state grants may offset costs. Incentive availability changes\u2014we identify current programs during project planning. Incentives often cover 30-50% of eligible costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What brands of DC fast chargers do you install?",
      "answer": "We work with all major DCFC manufacturers\u2014ABB, Tritium, ChargePoint, Blink, and others. Brand selection depends on your goals: pricing, network features, reliability reputation, and customer preferences. We can recommend based on your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install multiple fast chargers?",
      "answer": "Yes, and multi-unit sites are common for commercial destinations. We design infrastructure for multiple units with appropriate power sharing or independent circuits. Site power availability determines how many units you can support."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ongoing costs should I expect?",
      "answer": "Electrical costs (demand charges are significant), network/software fees, payment processing, maintenance, and occasional repairs. Revenue from charging typically covers costs at well-located sites. We can help you understand the economics."
