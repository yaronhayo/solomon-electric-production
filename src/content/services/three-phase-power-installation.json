  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between single-phase and three-phase power?",
      "answer": "Single-phase uses two wires (one hot, one neutral) with 120V power oscillating in one wave pattern. Three-phase uses three wires, each carrying power that peaks at different times, delivering smoother, more powerful electricity. Three-phase is more efficient for high-power applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is three-phase power available at my location?",
      "answer": "It depends on your location and utility infrastructure. Commercial areas often have three-phase available. Residential areas typically don't. We coordinate with FPL to determine availability and what's needed to bring three-phase to your location."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does three-phase installation cost?",
      "answer": "Costs vary widely based on utility work required, distance from three-phase source, and installation complexity. If three-phase is nearby, costs are moderate. If utility must extend three-phase infrastructure, costs increase significantly. We provide detailed quotes after site assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I run three-phase equipment on single-phase power?",
      "answer": "Not directly, but phase converters can create three-phase from single-phase power. Rotary phase converters work well for motors. Variable frequency drives (VFDs) can run single motors from single-phase. These are alternatives when true three-phase service isn't feasible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What equipment typically requires three-phase?",
      "answer": "Large motors (5+ HP), CNC machines, large air compressors, commercial HVAC, industrial welders, large commercial kitchen equipment, and data center power systems commonly require three-phase power."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does three-phase installation take?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends heavily on utility work required. If three-phase is available nearby, installation might take 2-4 weeks. If utility must extend three-phase infrastructure (new transformers, lines), it could take 2-6 months. We clarify expected timeline during assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What voltage is three-phase power?",
      "answer": "Common commercial three-phase voltages are 208V (wye configuration, common in smaller commercial) and 480V (larger industrial). The right voltage depends on your equipment requirements. We match service voltage to your equipment specifications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have both single-phase and three-phase in my facility?",
      "answer": "Yes. Three-phase service includes single-phase availability. Your three-phase panel can supply both three-phase circuits for appropriate equipment and single-phase circuits for lighting, outlets, and other standard loads."
