    },
    {
      "question": "Is a panel upgrade always required for an EV charger?",
      "answer": "A load calculation determines if the existing panel can handle the added amperage. In some cases, load-management devices can be used to balance demand without a full panel modernization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between hardwired and plug-in chargers?",
      "answer": "Hardwired installations allow for higher continuous amperage and fewer points of connection, while plug-in NEMA 14-50 configurations provide flexibility for equipment removal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are electrical permits required for home chargers?",
      "answer": "Yes, municipal building departments in South Florida require electrical permits for 240V circuit installations to verify safety and compliance with the Florida Building Code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the timeline for an EVSE installation?",
      "answer": "The duration of the physical installation depends on the distance from the electrical panel and the complexity of the wire run, such as underground or through structural attics."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Level 2 EV charger installation cost in {cityName}?",
      "answer": "Installation typically ranges from $500 to $1,500 depending on panel capacity, circuit distance, and charger type. We provide a free on-site estimate with transparent, upfront pricing before any work begins."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a Level 2 charger work with any electric vehicle?",
      "answer": "Yes. Level 2 chargers with a J1772 connector are universal and work with all EVs sold in North America. Tesla vehicles use an adapter or Tesla's proprietary connector. We install both universal and brand-specific chargers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a dedicated circuit for a Level 2 charger?",
      "answer": "Yes. Level 2 chargers require a dedicated 240V, 40-50 amp circuit. This means a new circuit from your panel to the charging location, with the proper wire gauge and breaker size based on the charger's power requirements."
