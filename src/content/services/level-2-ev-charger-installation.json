  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to install an EV charger in Miami?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Installing a Level 2 charger (240V) requires a dedicated 40-50 amp circuit—significant electrical work that requires permits to ensure your panel and wiring can handle the load safely. Solomon Electric handles all permit applications and inspection scheduling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install a Tesla charger if I don't have a Tesla?",
      "answer": "Yes! The Tesla Wall Connector works with all EVs when paired with a standard J1772 adapter (included in most non-Tesla EVs). The Tesla charger is well-designed and often preferred even by non-Tesla owners. Alternatively, we install universal charging stations like ChargePoint and JuiceBox."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast will a Level 2 charger charge my car?",
      "answer": "Level 2 chargers typically add 25-40 miles of range per hour, depending on your vehicle and charger amperage. This means a full charge overnight for most EVs—compared to Level 1 charging which might only add 40 miles in an entire night of charging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install an EV charger in my condo parking spot?",
      "answer": "Florida Statute 718.113 protects your right to install EV charging in your condo parking space. However, you must follow specific requirements: proper permits, adequate insurance, professional installation by a licensed electrician, and proper HOA notification. We specialize in code-compliant condo EV installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my electrical panel handle an EV charger?",
      "answer": "That depends on your current panel capacity and existing loads. Most 200-amp panels can accommodate a Level 2 charger. Older 100-amp panels often need upgrading. We perform a detailed load calculation during our site assessment and can bundle panel upgrades with charger installation if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get a hardwired charger or a NEMA 14-50 outlet?",
      "answer": "Both work excellently. A NEMA 14-50 outlet provides flexibility—you can unplug and take your portable charger to another location. Hardwired chargers often allow higher amperage and cleaner installation. We'll discuss your specific needs and recommend the best option."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install my charger outdoors?",
      "answer": "Yes. We regularly install outdoor chargers in driveways, carports, and open parking areas. We use weatherproof equipment, proper mounting, and code-compliant wiring protection to handle Florida's sun, rain, and humidity. Cable management options keep your installation neat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What brands of EV chargers do you install?",
      "answer": "We install all major brands: Tesla Wall Connector, ChargePoint, JuiceBox, Grizzl-E, Wallbox, ClipperCreek, and others. We also install NEMA 14-50 outlets for use with portable chargers included with your vehicle. If you have a preferred charger, we're happy to install it."
