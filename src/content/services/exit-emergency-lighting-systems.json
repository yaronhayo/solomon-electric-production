  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How often does emergency lighting need testing?",
      "answer": "Florida fire code requires monthly 30-second functional tests to verify lights illuminate on battery power. Annual testing requires 90-minute battery discharge to ensure full emergency duration. All testing must be documented."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between exit signs and emergency lights?",
      "answer": "Exit signs identify egress routes and must be illuminated at all times (with battery backup for outages). Emergency lights activate during power failures to illuminate paths to exits. Many installations use both, and combination units are available."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many emergency lights do I need?",
      "answer": "Placement depends on building layout and code requirements. Emergency lighting must illuminate egress paths to at least 1 foot-candle. We calculate proper placement to meet code while avoiding over-engineering."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I repair or replace old emergency lights?",
      "answer": "Units over 10-15 years old often cost more to repair than replace. New LED units use less energy, require less maintenance, and provide more reliable battery backup. We can assess whether repair or replacement makes more sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do emergency lighting testing myself?",
      "answer": "Building staff can perform monthly functional tests (press test button, verify illumination). Annual 90-minute testing typically requires an electrician to properly disconnect utility power and document the test. Many businesses outsource all testing for reliable compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I fail a fire inspection?",
      "answer": "Fire code violations require correction within a specified timeframe—often 30 days for minor issues. We provide rapid response to address citations, install compliant equipment, and provide documentation for re-inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do battery backup emergency lights drain power constantly?",
      "answer": "Emergency lights draw minimal power to keep batteries charged—typically a few watts. LED exit signs use only 2-5 watts continuously. The energy cost is negligible compared to the life safety value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about tenant spaces in commercial buildings?",
      "answer": "Each tenant space typically needs its own exit signage and emergency lighting appropriate to the space. We install to meet code requirements for individual tenant spaces and can coordinate with property management for common areas."
