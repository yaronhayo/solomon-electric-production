  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between low-voltage and line-voltage outdoor lighting?",
      "answer": "Low-voltage systems (12V) are safer, easier to install, and ideal for landscape lighting—path lights, uplights, and accent fixtures. Line-voltage (120V) is needed for larger fixtures, security floods, and wherever more power is required. We typically use low-voltage for landscaping and line-voltage for architectural and security applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do LED landscape lights compare to halogen?",
      "answer": "LED is superior in every way for outdoor use: 80% less energy, 50,000+ hour lifespan vs 2,000 for halogen, no heat (important in Florida), and more consistent light quality. While LED fixtures cost slightly more upfront, the energy and maintenance savings make them far more economical over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will landscape lighting increase my electric bill significantly?",
      "answer": "Not with LED. A typical landscape lighting system with 15-20 LED fixtures uses about the same power as a standard light bulb. Running 4-6 hours per night typically costs just a few dollars per month. The security and enjoyment benefits far outweigh the minimal energy cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle Florida's rain and humidity?",
      "answer": "All outdoor electrical work must withstand Florida's climate. We use fixtures rated for wet locations, waterproof connection methods, properly buried cables, and GFCI protection where required. Quality fixtures and proper installation techniques ensure long-term reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can landscape lighting be added to existing landscaping?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Low-voltage cable can be buried with minimal disturbance to established plants. Fixtures are positioned without disturbing root systems. Most landscape lighting installations complete without significant damage to existing landscaping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer smart outdoor lighting controls?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can integrate landscape lighting with smart home systems—controlling lights from your phone, setting schedules, adjusting brightness, and even changing colors with RGB-capable fixtures. Sunset-activated automation ensures lights come on exactly when needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent light pollution and neighbor complaints?",
      "answer": "Professional design considers light angles and shielding to direct light where intended—not into neighbors' windows or the sky. Downlighting, proper fixture selection, and thoughtful placement create beautiful effects while being a good neighbor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about fixture maintenance?",
      "answer": "LED fixtures require minimal maintenance—occasional cleaning and adjustment. With no bulbs to replace for years, maintenance is dramatically reduced versus older systems. We can provide annual maintenance service to keep your system performing optimally."
