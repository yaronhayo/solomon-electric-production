    {
      "question": "What does an electrical safety inspection include?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive inspection covers your electrical panel (capacity, connections, recalls), visible wiring (condition, materials, code compliance), outlets and switches (grounding, polarity, GFCI function), grounding system, and any areas of concern you've noticed. You receive a detailed written report with findings and recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does an electrical inspection take?",
      "answer": "A thorough residential inspection typically takes 1-2 hours depending on home size and complexity. We don't rush—proper inspection requires methodical examination. You'll receive your written report within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is electrical inspection different from home inspection?",
      "answer": "Yes, significantly. General home inspectors check that outlets work and the panel has no obvious problems—a 5-10 minute electrical review. Professional electrical inspections involve detailed examination by licensed electricians who understand code requirements, hidden hazards, and system integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you test outlets behind furniture?",
      "answer": "We test all reasonably accessible outlets. We can move light furniture, but we won't disassemble rooms. Let us know about any outlets you've had concerns with so we can prioritize those locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find serious problems?",
      "answer": "If we identify immediate safety hazards (active fire risks, shock hazards), we'll explain the situation clearly and recommend shutting off affected circuits until repairs are made. For less urgent issues, we'll include them in your prioritized report so you can plan repairs on your timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you do inspections for insurance companies?",
      "answer": "Yes. We provide electrical inspections that satisfy insurance company requirements, including 4-point inspections frequently required for homes over 30 years old. Our reports include the documentation insurers need to assess or renew coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect before I buy a home?",
      "answer": "Pre-purchase electrical inspections are one of our most important services. General home inspections miss significant electrical issues. Before committing to a major purchase, understand exactly what electrical work you'll need—often saving negotiations money or avoiding costly surprises."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common problems you find?",
      "answer": "Common issues include double-tapped breakers, missing GFCI protection, ungrounded outlets, recalled panel brands (Federal Pacific, Zinsco), improper DIY wiring, undersized circuits for modern loads, and degraded aluminum wiring connections. Most aren't immediately dangerous but should be addressed."

      "heading": "Beyond the General Home Inspection",
      "body": "When you buy a home, the general inspector spends maybe 10 minutes on electrical—checking that lights work and the panel looks okay. A dedicated electrical inspection goes far deeper: examining connection quality, testing outlet grounding, verifying GFCI function, identifying recalled equipment, and assessing wiring condition. If you're buying a home over 25 years old, electrical inspection isn't optional—it's essential."

Solomon Electric provides inspection reports that satisfy insurance requirements."

      "heading": "Honest Assessments, Prioritized Recommendations",
      "body": "We don't create unnecessary work. Our inspection reports prioritize findings by urgency—immediate safety hazards that need prompt attention, code updates that should be addressed, and improvements to consider for the future. You'll understand what's truly important versus what's merely not up to current standards in older homes."
