    {
      "question": "What is the difference between this and a home inspection?",
      "answer": "Significantly different. General home inspectors check basic functions—a 5-10 minute review. Professional electrical inspections involve deep examination by licensed electricians who understand code requirements, hidden hazards, and system integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this the same as a 4-point inspection?",
      "answer": "We provide the comprehensive electrical component of the 4-point inspection. We deliver the specific documentation required by Florida insurers to verify the panel, wiring, and safety systems meet their coverage standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if you find serious problems?",
      "answer": "If we identify immediate safety hazards (fire risks or shock hazards), we explain the situation clearly and recommend immediate fixes. For other items, we include them in a prioritized report so you can plan repairs on your timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you provide certification for real estate closings?",
      "answer": "Yes. We offer pre-purchase and pre-sale inspection certifications that provide the documentation buyers, lenders, and real estate professionals need to proceed with confidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the inspection take?",
      "answer": "Typically 1-2 hours depending on the home size. We are methodical and do not rush. You will receive your written report and any applicable certifications within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will an old panel fail the inspection automatically?",
      "answer": "Age alone isn't always a failure, but safety and condition are. However, certain recalled brands like Federal Pacific or Zinsco are known hazards and will be noted as such, as most insurers require their replacement for coverage."
