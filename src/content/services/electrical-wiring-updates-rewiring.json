  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my house needs rewiring?",
      "answer": "Key indicators include: home built before 1970 (especially with original wiring), aluminum wiring present, cloth-covered wiring visible in attic, frequent breaker trips, flickering lights, two-prong outlets throughout, or warm outlets/switches. We offer assessments to evaluate your wiring condition and recommend appropriate action."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does whole-home rewiring take?",
      "answer": "Complete rewiring typically takes 3-5 days for an average home, depending on size, accessibility, and complexity. We can often work room-by-room to minimize disruption, restoring power to each area as it's completed rather than leaving the whole house without power."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will rewiring require cutting holes in my walls?",
      "answer": "Some wall access is usually necessary, but we minimize this using techniques that route wires through attics, crawl spaces, and existing pathways. When wall cuts are needed, we make them strategically and can recommend drywall repair resources. The safety benefits far outweigh minor repair needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is aluminum wiring really dangerous?",
      "answer": "Aluminum wiring itself isn't inherently dangerous, but its connections to outlets, switches, and breakers develop problems over time. Aluminum oxidizes, expands differently than copper, and requires specific connectors. The documented fire risk comes from these connection points. Remediation options include complete replacement or installing approved aluminum-to-copper connectors (COPALUM or AlumiConn)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for rewiring?",
      "answer": "Yes. Rewiring is significant electrical work requiring permits from your local building department. Permits ensure work is inspected for safety and creates documentation important for insurance and home sales. Solomon Electric handles all permitting and inspection coordination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rewire during a renovation?",
      "answer": "Absolutely\u2014renovations are the ideal time for rewiring. With walls already open, we can install new wiring with minimal additional disruption or cost. We coordinate with contractors to ensure electrical work fits the renovation timeline and meets your updated needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of wire do you use?",
      "answer": "We use copper wiring throughout, typically 12-gauge for 20-amp circuits and 14-gauge for 15-amp circuits. For dedicated circuits (AC, dryer, EV charger), we use appropriate heavier gauge wire. All wiring is NM-B (Romex) rated for residential applications and meets current NEC standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will new wiring add outlets where I need them?",
      "answer": "Yes! Rewiring projects are the perfect opportunity to add outlets where you've always wanted them\u2014home office areas, kitchen islands, workshop spaces, outdoor locations. We design new circuits to serve your actual needs, not just replicate outdated outlet placement."
