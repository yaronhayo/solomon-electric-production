    {
      "question": "What electrical work requires permits?",
      "answer": "Generally: new circuits, panel changes/upgrades, service changes, new receptacle or fixture additions, and any work requiring 'opening up' the electrical system. Simple repairs (replacing devices, replacing fixtures in kind) typically don't require permits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should I care about permits?",
      "answer": "Permits protect you: work is inspected for safety and code compliance, insurance remains valid, and property sales aren't complicated by unpermitted work questions. The cost and time are minimal compared to the protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if previous work wasn't permitted?",
      "answer": "Options include: leave it alone (may cause problems later), apply for after-the-fact permits (if work is up to code), or correct and permit as new work. We can assess the situation and recommend appropriate approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle permits, or do I?",
      "answer": "We handle everything. We prepare applications, submit to the building department, pay fees (included or pass-through), schedule inspections, and attend inspections. You just need to sign permit applications as property owner."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does permit approval take?",
      "answer": "Simple residential permits are often approved quickly or within a few days. Complex or commercial permits take longer. We submit promptly and follow up to minimize delays."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if inspection fails?",
      "answer": "We design work to pass inspection first time. If an inspector requires changes, we make them promptly and schedule re-inspection. Our pass rate is excellent, but any corrections are our responsibility to address."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documentation do I receive?",
      "answer": "You receive copies of the approved permit and passed inspection record. These documents prove work was properly permitted and inspected—important for insurance claims, property sales, and your records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are permit fees included in your quotes?",
      "answer": "We can include fees in quotes or pass through at cost—whichever you prefer. Fees vary by municipality and scope of work, typically $50-200 for residential work, more for larger commercial projects."
