  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much can LED parking lights save?",
      "answer": "Typical savings are 60-70% on lighting electricity. Commercial lighting costs typically drop significantly after an LED retrofit, and the investment often pays for itself through energy and maintenance savings within a few years."
    },
    {
      "question": "What light level should a parking lot have?",
      "answer": "IES recommends 1-5 foot-candles for parking areas, with higher levels (5-10 fc) near entrances and pedestrian paths. We design to appropriate levels for your use—higher for high-crime areas or evening-primary businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we retrofit existing fixtures or replace poles?",
      "answer": "It depends on pole and fixture condition. LED retrofit kits can convert existing fixtures cost-effectively. If poles are damaged, corroded, or poorly positioned, full replacement makes more sense. We recommend the appropriate approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should parking lot lights be controlled?",
      "answer": "Photocells (dusk-to-dawn) are standard—lights automatically activate at dusk. Timer overrides can turn lights off late at night if the lot is closed. Some systems include motion dimming—lights dim when the lot is empty, brighten with activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about light pollution to neighbors?",
      "answer": "Modern fixtures include optics that direct light downward rather than outward. We select and aim fixtures to light your lot while minimizing spill to adjacent properties—important for good neighbor relations and some zoning requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does installation take?",
      "answer": "Retrofit projects converting existing poles to LED can often complete in 1-2 days. New installations with new poles take longer—typically 1-2 weeks depending on lot size. We schedule to minimize disruption to your operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide maintenance after installation?",
      "answer": "Yes. We offer maintenance programs for commercial lighting—periodic inspection, cleaning, and rapid response for any failures. LEDs fail rarely, but when fixtures or controls need attention, we respond quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there utility incentives for LED parking lights?",
      "answer": "FPL offers rebates for commercial LED lighting retrofits. Incentives vary by fixture type and efficiency. We identify applicable incentives during project planning—often covering 20-30% of upgrade costs."
