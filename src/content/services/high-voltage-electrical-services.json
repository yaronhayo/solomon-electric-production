  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What qualifies as high-voltage?",
      "answer": "Terminology varies, but generally: low voltage is up to 600V (common commercial), medium voltage is 600V-35kV (industrial distribution), high voltage is above 35kV (transmission). Most 'high-voltage' industrial work is technically medium voltage distribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should a facility use medium voltage service?",
      "answer": "Generally when total load exceeds 500-1000 kVA. At these sizes, medium voltage service with on-site transformation becomes more cost-effective than the large low-voltage service that would be required."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's involved in switchgear maintenance?",
      "answer": "Switchgear requires periodic inspection, cleaning, lubrication of mechanisms, protective relay testing, and insulation testing. Frequency depends on equipment type and usage—typically annual or biennial for critical systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you perform arc flash studies?",
      "answer": "Yes. Arc flash studies calculate incident energy levels at each point in the electrical system, determining required PPE for safe work. OSHA requires employers to assess and label electrical hazards—arc flash studies fulfill this requirement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work on energized high-voltage systems?",
      "answer": "We have trained and qualified personnel for high-voltage work, but most high-voltage work is performed de-energized with proper lockout/tagout. Some testing and troubleshooting requires energized work with appropriate precautions and PPE."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about power factor correction?",
      "answer": "Poor power factor increases utility bills (power factor penalties) and reduces system capacity. We design and install power factor correction equipment—typically capacitor banks—to improve power factor to acceptable levels."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do high-voltage projects take?",
      "answer": "Timelines vary significantly. Equipment lead times for switchgear and transformers can be 16-40+ weeks. Utility coordination adds months. Simple additions to existing systems are faster; new installations take 6-18 months typically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide 24/7 emergency response for industrial systems?",
      "answer": "Yes. Production facilities can't wait for business hours. We provide emergency response for industrial electrical failures, prioritizing production-critical systems."
