    {
      "question": "What's included in an electrical inspection?",
      "answer": "We examine the electrical panel (capacity, conditions, recalls), accessible wiring (type, condition, installation quality), outlets and switches (grounding, polarity, GFCI function), grounding system, and any safety systems. You receive a detailed written report with findings and recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this different from a home inspection?",
      "answer": "Significantly. General home inspectors spend 5-10 minutes on electrical—checking that lights work and the panel has no obvious problems. Our dedicated inspection involves thorough examination by a licensed electrician who understands electrical systems, codes, and safety requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does an electrical inspection take?",
      "answer": "A thorough residential inspection typically takes 1-2 hours depending on home size and complexity. Larger or more complex properties take longer. You'll receive your written report within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect for insurance requirements?",
      "answer": "Yes. We provide electrical inspections that satisfy insurance company requirements including 4-point inspections. Our reports include the documentation insurers need to assess or renew coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find serious problems?",
      "answer": "If we identify immediate safety hazards, we'll explain the situation and recommend appropriate action—potentially shutting off affected circuits. For less urgent issues, we include them in your prioritized report so you can plan repairs appropriately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide repair estimates?",
      "answer": "We can provide repair estimates for issues we identify. Many clients prefer understanding the overall investment needed before deciding how to proceed. This helps with budgeting and real estate negotiations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you put your findings in writing?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Every inspection includes a detailed written report documenting our findings, any concerns, and prioritized recommendations. This documentation is suitable for insurance, real estate, or personal records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect before I make an offer on a home?",
      "answer": "Yes, pre-offer inspections are possible if the seller grants access. More commonly, we perform inspections during the inspection period after your offer is accepted. Understanding electrical condition before closing protects your investment."
