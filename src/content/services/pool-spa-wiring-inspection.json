    {
      "question": "What does pool electrical bonding mean?",
      "answer": "Bonding connects all metal components (pool shell, ladder, rails, pump motor, heater) with continuous copper conductors to create equal electrical potential. Without proper bonding, voltage differences between components can electrocute swimmers touching two surfaces simultaneously. It's the most critical pool safety system."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should pool electrical systems be inspected?",
      "answer": "We recommend inspection every 3-5 years, whenever you purchase or sell a home with a pool, after major equipment replacements, and immediately if you notice any electrical problems (tripping breakers, shocks, equipment issues). Florida's corrosive environment accelerates electrical degradation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between bonding and grounding?",
      "answer": "Bonding connects metal components together to equalize voltage. Grounding connects equipment to earth to provide a fault path. Both are required for pool safety, but they serve different purposes. We verify both systems during inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do all pool circuits need GFCI protection?",
      "answer": "Yes. The National Electrical Code requires GFCI protection for all pool equipment circuits\u2014pumps, lights, heaters, and any receptacles within 20 feet of the pool. We test all GFCI protection to ensure proper operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect pool electrical for home sales?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We provide detailed pool electrical inspection reports suitable for real estate transactions, insurance requirements, and buyer due diligence. Our reports document current conditions and clearly identify any safety concerns or code violations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find problems during inspection?",
      "answer": "If we identify safety hazards, we'll explain the severity and recommend whether equipment should be shut down pending repairs. For code violations that aren't immediately dangerous, we'll provide prioritized recommendations. We can also quote repair work if you'd like us to correct the issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a pool electrical inspection take?",
      "answer": "A typical residential pool inspection takes 1-2 hours depending on equipment complexity. Pools with extensive automation, multiple pumps, or spa systems take longer. You'll receive your written report within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you inspect salt water pool systems?",
      "answer": "Yes. Salt water chlorine generators have specific electrical requirements and can accelerate corrosion on bonding connections. We pay special attention to bonding integrity and ensure salt system installation meets manufacturer and code requirements."
