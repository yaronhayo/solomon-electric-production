  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do all outdoor outlets need GFCI protection?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Florida electrical code (following NEC) requires GFCI protection for all outdoor outlets. This protects users from ground faults that could cause electrocution when exposed to rain, sprinklers, or wet conditions. No exceptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's an in-use cover vs. a standard weatherproof cover?",
      "answer": "Standard weatherproof covers protect outlets when nothing is plugged in. In-use covers (bubble covers) protect even when a cord is plugged in\u2014this is required by code for outlets in exposed locations. We install appropriate covers for each location."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many outdoor outlets do I need?",
      "answer": "Code requires outlets on front and back of homes, but convenience often calls for more. Consider outlets near: patio seating, outdoor kitchen, pool equipment, landscape lighting transformers, garden beds, and garage exterior. More outlets means less extension cord use."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can outdoor outlets handle holiday lights?",
      "answer": "Standard 15 or 20-amp outdoor outlets handle typical holiday light installations. For extensive displays, dedicated circuits prevent overloading. We can assess your holiday lighting needs and install appropriate capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about outlets near pools and hot tubs?",
      "answer": "Pool area outlets have specific code requirements: GFCI protection is mandatory, and outlets must maintain minimum distances from the pool edge (typically 6-20 feet depending on the application). We understand and follow all pool electrical requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do outdoor outlets work in rain?",
      "answer": "Properly installed outdoor outlets function safely in rain. Wet-rated boxes, in-use covers, and GFCI protection work together to provide safe operation even during Florida's afternoon thunderstorms. Never use damaged outlets or covers in wet conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add outlets to my existing patio?",
      "answer": "Yes. We can add outlets to existing outdoor spaces by running conduit along surfaces or under-deck, or by running wire through walls to access exterior locations. We'll determine the best approach for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What wire is used for outdoor electrical?",
      "answer": "Underground outdoor circuits use UF (Underground Feeder) cable or standard wire in conduit. Above-ground outdoor installations typically use conduit for protection. We select appropriate materials based on installation location and method."
