  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Where does commercial code require GFCI?",
      "answer": "Required locations include: kitchen areas within 6 feet of sinks, restrooms, rooftops, outdoors, garages/service bays, near pools/hot tubs, and more. Specific requirements depend on building type and use. We identify all required locations for your facility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between GFCI outlets and breakers?",
      "answer": "GFCI outlets protect that outlet and potentially downstream outlets. GFCI breakers protect entire circuits including all wiring and connected devices. For commercial, breakers often provide more comprehensive protection and easier testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should commercial GFCI be tested?",
      "answer": "Monthly testing is recommended—press test button, verify trip, press reset. Some facilities require documented testing. We can provide periodic testing services or train your staff on proper testing procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can GFCI cause nuisance tripping?",
      "answer": "GFCI trips when it detects current leakage—sometimes from equipment with normal leakage (old refrigerators, certain tools). If tripping is frequent, the solution may be equipment repair, dedicated circuits, or addressing actual leakage issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are older buildings exempt from GFCI requirements?",
      "answer": "Existing non-compliant installations may be grandfathered, but modifications trigger current code requirements. Additionally, life safety considerations may warrant GFCI installation even when not strictly required. We clarify what's legally required vs. recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about tenant spaces in commercial buildings?",
      "answer": "Each tenant space should have GFCI protection in required locations. Responsibility (landlord vs. tenant) depends on lease terms. We work with both property managers and tenants to ensure proper protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you provide testing documentation for inspections?",
      "answer": "Yes. We document GFCI installations with locations, dates, and test verification. This documentation supports fire marshal inspections, insurance audits, and compliance records."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if GFCI keeps tripping in our commercial kitchen?",
      "answer": "Kitchen GFCI tripping usually indicates moisture issues, equipment problems, or circuit overloads. We diagnose the cause—it may be equipment needing repair, circuit reorganization, or addressing moisture intrusion."
