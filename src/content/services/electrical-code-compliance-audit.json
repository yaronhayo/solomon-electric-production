    {
      "question": "What is the National Electrical Code (NEC)?",
      "answer": "The NEC is the standard for safe electrical installation in the United States. It's updated every three years. Florida adopts the NEC (with some modifications) as state law. Our compliance audits reference the currently adopted code version."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are older installations grandfathered?",
      "answer": "Generally, installations that met code when installed remain legal ('grandfathered'). However, modifications to existing systems typically must meet current code. Safety hazards may require correction regardless of when installed. We explain what applies to your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have unpermitted work?",
      "answer": "Unpermitted electrical work creates liability and can complicate sales. Options include: retroactive permitting (if work is up to code), correction and permitting, or disclosure and negotiation during sale. We identify unpermitted work and explain your options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to bring everything up to current code?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Existing compliant work is typically grandfathered. Current code applies when you modify or add to the system. However, safety hazards should be addressed regardless of grandfathering. We clarify what's required vs. recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you provide repair estimates?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our audit reports include estimated costs for recommended repairs. This helps you budget and make informed decisions about remediation priorities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you handle the repairs after the audit?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many clients prefer one company to handle both audit and remediation. We already understand your property and can execute repairs efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is a compliance audit different from a safety inspection?",
      "answer": "Safety inspections focus on immediate hazards—things that could cause fire or shock now. Compliance audits are more comprehensive, examining whether installations meet code requirements even when not immediately dangerous. Compliance audits include safety assessment but go further."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documentation do I receive?",
      "answer": "You receive a detailed written report documenting: compliance status, specific violations found (with code references), safety hazards identified, prioritized recommendations, and estimated repair costs. This documentation is suitable for insurance, real estate, or permit purposes."
