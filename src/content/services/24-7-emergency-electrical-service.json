    {
      "question": "What qualifies as an electrical emergency?",
      "answer": "Any situation that poses immediate risk to safety or property qualifies as an emergency: burning smells from electrical components, sparking outlets, complete power loss, exposed wires, electrical shocks, buzzing panels, or any situation where you fear a fire could start. When in doubt, call us—we'd rather assess a non-emergency than have you wait during a dangerous situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can an electrician arrive at my home?",
      "answer": "Response times depend on current call volume and your location, but we prioritize true emergencies. For fire hazards, sparking, or electrical shocks, we dispatch immediately. Our service area covers all of Miami-Dade and Broward counties, with electricians strategically positioned throughout the region."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you charge more for nights, weekends, or holidays?",
      "answer": "We offer transparent, competitive emergency rates. While emergency calls naturally require premium availability, we don't exploit crisis situations with excessive markups. You'll receive upfront pricing before any work begins—no surprises on your bill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I turn off my power before you arrive?",
      "answer": "If you smell burning, see sparking, or feel the situation is immediately dangerous, go to your main breaker and switch it OFF. This eliminates power to your home and stops most electrical hazards. If you're unsure where your main breaker is or feel unsafe approaching your panel, leave the home and call us immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the repair needs parts you don't have?",
      "answer": "Our service vehicles carry the most common replacement parts—breakers, outlets, wiring, connectors, and safety devices. For unusual equipment or specialized repairs, we'll secure the area, provide a temporary safe solution if possible, and return promptly with the required materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle commercial and business emergencies?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We serve residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Business electrical emergencies—especially those affecting operations, safety systems, or refrigeration—receive priority response. We understand that downtime costs money."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas do you serve for emergency calls?",
      "answer": "We provide emergency electrical service throughout Miami-Dade County (Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Hialeah, Kendall) and Broward County (Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Pembroke Pines, Coral Springs, Deerfield Beach). Call us even if you're unsure—we'll let you know if we can help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I wait until morning if the problem seems minor?",
      "answer": "If there's no burning smell, sparking, shock hazard, or heat coming from electrical components, many issues can safely wait. However, if you're losing sleep worrying about it, that's often your instinct telling you something is wrong. Trust your gut—the peace of mind from a professional assessment is worth it."
