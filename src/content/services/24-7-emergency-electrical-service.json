      "answer": "Emergency services are provided throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties, with technicians located in various areas to facilitate response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will utility providers shut off power during a repair?",
      "answer": "Utility companies typically manage power delivery to the meter. If the problem is internal or at the meter enclosure, a private electrician must perform repairs before service can be safely restored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are emergency services available during non-business hours?",
      "answer": "Yes, emergency response is available 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays, to address critical electrical failures and safety concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should a buzzing panel be ignored?",
      "answer": "No. Audible buzzing often indicates arcing, where electricity jumps between connections. This creates intense heat and represents a serious fire risk that requires attention."
