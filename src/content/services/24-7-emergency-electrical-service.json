  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is an electrical burning smell always an emergency?",
      "answer": "Yes. A burning smell indicates that electrical insulation may be smoldering, which can precede an electrical fire. It is important to turn off the main breaker and have the system inspected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which areas receive emergency service?",
      "answer": "Emergency services are provided throughout {county} and Broward counties, with technicians located in various areas to facilitate response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will utility providers shut off power during a repair?",
      "answer": "Utility companies typically manage power delivery to the meter. If the problem is internal or at the meter enclosure, a private electrician must perform repairs before service can be safely restored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are emergency services available during non-business hours?",
      "answer": "Yes, emergency response is available 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays, to address critical electrical failures and safety concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should a buzzing panel be ignored?",
      "answer": "No. Audible buzzing often indicates arcing, where electricity jumps between connections. This creates intense heat and represents a serious fire risk that requires attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What qualifies as an electrical emergency?",
      "answer": "Sparking outlets, burning smells from panels or wires, total power loss, exposed live wiring, water contact with electrical systems, and any situation posing immediate fire or shock risk. When in doubt, call—our dispatchers help assess the urgency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can an emergency electrician arrive?",
      "answer": "Our typical response time is 30 to 60 minutes for {county} and Broward areas. We maintain on-call crews around the clock so a licensed electrician is always available, including weekends and holidays."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are emergency electrical repairs more expensive than scheduled service?",
      "answer": "Emergency rates may include a service call fee, but we provide upfront pricing before any work begins. There are no hidden charges, and the cost of ignoring a genuine emergency—fire damage, equipment failure—far exceeds the service fee."
