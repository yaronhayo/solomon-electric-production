  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What outlet type do I need for EV charging?",
      "answer": "NEMA 14-50 is most common\u201450A, 240V outlet used by most portable EVSE. Some chargers use NEMA 14-30 or NEMA 6-50. Check your portable EVSE's plug type. When in doubt, NEMA 14-50 provides maximum flexibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is outlet charging as fast as dedicated EVSE?",
      "answer": "Speed depends on your portable EVSE's power output, not the outlet. Most portable EVSE deliver 32A (about 25 miles/hour). Some deliver up to 40A on 50A outlets. Hardwired EVSE can deliver up to 48A but requires larger circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I install an outlet or hardwired EVSE?",
      "answer": "Outlets offer flexibility and lower initial cost\u2014good if you're new to EVs or want to try different chargers. Hardwired EVSE offers slightly higher power (up to 48A), permanent installation, and often smart features. Either works well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use a regular 240V outlet I already have?",
      "answer": "Possibly, if it's a proper heavy-duty outlet (14-50, 14-30, 6-50, etc.) on a dedicated circuit. Standard dryer outlets may work but shouldn't be shared with dryers. We can evaluate your existing outlet's suitability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should the outlet be located?",
      "answer": "Typically inside the garage near where the EV's charge port parks. If parking outside, we install outdoor-rated enclosures. Height should allow comfortable EVSE connection. We plan location with you before installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install outside for carport or driveway parking?",
      "answer": "Yes. Outdoor EV outlets require weatherproof enclosures (while-in-use covers or lockable boxes). We install outdoor-rated outlets for carport and driveway charging locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my panel doesn't have room for a new circuit?",
      "answer": "Options include: panel upgrade to add capacity, tandem breakers where code allows, or load management devices that share capacity with other circuits. We assess your panel and recommend appropriate solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I upgrade to hardwired EVSE later?",
      "answer": "Yes. The circuit we install supports future hardwired EVSE. When you're ready to upgrade, we disconnect the outlet, install the EVSE, and connect to the existing circuit. Infrastructure work is already done."
