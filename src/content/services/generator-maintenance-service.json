  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How often should my generator be serviced?",
      "answer": "Annually at minimum. Most manufacturers recommend service every 100-200 hours of operation OR annually, whichever comes first. If your generator runs frequently (multiple outages), more frequent service may be appropriate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does annual maintenance include?",
      "answer": "Comprehensive service includes: oil and filter change, air filter inspection/replacement, spark plug inspection/replacement (gas units), battery testing, coolant check (liquid-cooled), fuel system inspection, operational testing, and transfer switch verification."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did my generator fail to start during the last outage?",
      "answer": "Common causes include: dead or weak battery (#1 cause), stale fuel (gas units left sitting), low oil (auto-shutoff protection), transfer switch issues, or mechanical problems from lack of maintenance. We diagnose and repair start failures."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do generator batteries last?",
      "answer": "Typically 3-4 years in Florida's heat. Weekly exercise runs help but don't prevent eventual failure. We recommend proactive battery replacement every 3 years rather than waiting for failure during an outage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to change the oil if my generator rarely runs?",
      "answer": "Yes—annual oil changes are recommended regardless of runtime. Oil degrades over time even when not running. Contaminants from combustion accumulate during exercise runs. Fresh oil protects the engine whether it runs 10 hours or 100."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's load bank testing?",
      "answer": "Load bank testing runs the generator at full rated capacity using a load bank device. This verifies the generator can actually deliver rated power and that all systems function properly under load. Weekly exercise runs are typically light load only."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I service my generator before or after hurricane season?",
      "answer": "Before. Spring service ensures your generator is ready when hurricane season starts in June. Post-season service is also valuable if the generator ran significantly during storms, but pre-season service is the priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you set up automatic maintenance reminders?",
      "answer": "Yes. We track service dates and can remind you when annual maintenance is due. Many clients prefer maintenance schedules that ensure their generator is serviced every spring before hurricane season."
