  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why isn't the general home inspection enough?",
      "answer": "General home inspectors aren't licensed electricians. They typically spend 10 minutes on electrical—checking that lights work and the panel isn't obviously damaged. They don't identify recalled panels, wiring problems, code violations, or capacity issues. Electrical problems are the #1 thing home inspectors miss."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I schedule the electrical inspection?",
      "answer": "Schedule during your inspection period—the same timeframe as your general home inspection. Coordinate timing so you can negotiate or walk away based on findings. Don't wait until after your inspection period expires."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find serious problems?",
      "answer": "Serious findings give you options: request seller repairs before closing, negotiate price reduction to cover repair costs, request seller credit at closing, or walk away if issues are too severe. Your realtor can help you negotiate using our documented findings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do typical repairs cost?",
      "answer": "Costs vary depending on the scope of the project. Minor functional repairs are typically modest, while major items like panel replacements or whole-house remediation are more significant investments. We provide detailed estimates in our report to give you clear guidance for your negotiations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the house has aluminum wiring?",
      "answer": "Aluminum branch circuit wiring (common 1965-1975) presents fire risks at connections. It doesn't require immediate replacement but needs proper connectors and monitoring. We identify aluminum wiring and explain the implications for your buying decision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the inspection worth it for newer homes?",
      "answer": "Even newer homes benefit from inspection. We find issues in homes 5-10 years old—improper DIY work, builder shortcuts, and early failures. The cost of inspection is insignificant compared to unexpected repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide repair estimates for negotiation?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our reports include estimated repair costs for identified issues. This documentation supports your negotiation position with solid numbers rather than guesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you do the repairs if I buy the house?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. If you purchase and want us to handle recommended repairs, we already understand the property and can prioritize work appropriately. Many clients return to us after closing for repairs identified during inspection."
