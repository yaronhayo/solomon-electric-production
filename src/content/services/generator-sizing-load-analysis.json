  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do you calculate generator size?",
      "answer": "We inventory all loads requiring backup, determine their running power (watts), calculate starting power for motors (3-6x running), account for future additions, and add safety margin. The result is minimum recommended capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size generator do I need for my home?",
      "answer": "It varies widely. A small home backing up only essentials (refrigerator, some lights, outlets) might need 10-12 kW. Running central AC typically requires 18-24 kW or larger. Whole-house backup for larger homes may need 30-48 kW. Load analysis determines your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I run my central AC on a generator?",
      "answer": "Yes, with adequate sizing. A 3-ton AC needs roughly 3-4 kW running but 8-12 kW to start. The generator must handle starting surge plus other running loads. We calculate whether your AC can run with other priorities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between running and starting watts?",
      "answer": "Running watts are continuous load when equipment operates. Starting watts are the brief surge when motors start—typically 3-6x running watts. Generators must handle peak starting loads plus running loads of already-operating equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I size for future needs?",
      "answer": "If you're planning additions—EV charger, pool, expanding your home—sizing for future loads costs less than upgrading later. We help you plan appropriate capacity for both current and planned needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can only afford a smaller generator?",
      "answer": "Strategic load selection can significantly reduce required size. Perhaps you back up a window AC unit instead of central, or prioritize refrigerator and lights while skipping high-draw items. We help you prioritize effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is your sizing affiliated with a specific brand?",
      "answer": "No. We provide brand-neutral sizing based on your loads. Once you know required capacity, you can compare brands for features and pricing. We can recommend brands but our sizing isn't designed to sell any particular brand."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does fuel type affect sizing?",
      "answer": "Generator output varies slightly by fuel. Natural gas typically provides 85-90% of rated output vs. propane. Diesel units have different sizing curves. We specify appropriate capacity for your chosen fuel type."
