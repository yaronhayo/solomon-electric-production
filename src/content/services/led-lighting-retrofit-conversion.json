    {
      "question": "What does LED retrofit mean?",
      "answer": "LED retrofit means converting existing fixtures to LED without replacing the entire fixture. For recessed cans, this often means installing retrofit kits that replace the bulb and trim. For fluorescent fixtures, it may mean LED tubes with ballast bypass. Retrofit is typically more cost-effective than complete fixture replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What color temperature should I choose?",
      "answer": "LED color temperature affects ambiance: Warm white (2700K) is similar to incandescent—cozy for living rooms and bedrooms. Neutral white (3000K) is versatile for most spaces. Cool white (4000K) is crisp and energizing—good for kitchens and workspaces. We help you select appropriate temperatures for each area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my existing dimmers work with LED?",
      "answer": "Often not. Older dimmers designed for incandescent bulbs can cause LED flickering, buzzing, and limited dimming range. We assess your dimmers and upgrade to LED-compatible models when needed for smooth, quiet operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can fluorescent fixtures be converted to LED?",
      "answer": "Yes, with several options: LED tubes work in existing fixtures (with or without ballast modification), or we can replace fixtures entirely with LED panels or fixtures. The best approach depends on fixture condition, ceiling type, and your goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will LED conversion save?",
      "answer": "A typical home converting from incandescent to LED saves $100-300+ annually on lighting electricity, depending on usage. Fluorescent-to-LED saves less but still reduces energy and eliminates tube replacement costs. LEDs typically pay for themselves within 1-2 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are all LED bulbs the same quality?",
      "answer": "No. Cheap LED bulbs can have poor color quality, inconsistent brightness, and shorter lifespan. We use quality LED products from reputable manufacturers that deliver consistent performance, accurate color, and rated lifespan. The small cost difference is worth the quality improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will LED light look different from what I'm used to?",
      "answer": "LED light quality varies by product and color temperature. We select LEDs that match or improve upon your current lighting character. If you love warm incandescent light, we choose warm white LEDs. The transition should feel natural—just more efficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you convert my entire home to LED at once?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Whole-home LED conversion is often the most cost-effective approach—we can negotiate better pricing on materials and complete the work efficiently. Many homeowners choose whole-home conversion for consistency and to maximize savings immediately."
