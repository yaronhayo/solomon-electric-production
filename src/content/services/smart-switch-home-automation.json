  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need a neutral wire for smart switches?",
      "answer": "Most smart switches require a neutral wire for power, but many older homes don't have neutral wires in switch boxes. We can: 1) install neutral-wire-not-required switches (Lutron Caseta, some Inovelli), 2) run a neutral wire to the switch box, or 3) use smart bulbs instead. We'll assess your situation and recommend the best approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which smart home system is best?",
      "answer": "It depends on your ecosystem. If you have iPhones and Apple devices, HomeKit offers the best integration. Alexa works well for Amazon households. Google Home suits Android users. For maximum flexibility, Zigbee or Z-Wave devices with a SmartThings or Hubitat hub work across platforms. We'll help you choose based on your existing devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will smart switches work with my existing light fixtures?",
      "answer": "Yes, smart switches replace the wall switch and work with any fixture. However, smart dimmers must be compatible with your bulb type—LED, incandescent, or CFL. We verify compatibility and select dimmers rated for your specific fixtures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install smart switches in a 3-way configuration?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Three-way switches (controlling one light from two locations) require specific smart switch setups—typically a smart switch at one location and a companion switch at the other. We configure these correctly so both switches work as expected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to smart switches during power outages?",
      "answer": "Smart switches still function as regular switches during power outages—you can still turn lights on and off manually. When power returns, most smart switches reconnect automatically to your WiFi and resume normal smart operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install smart thermostats too?",
      "answer": "Yes! Smart thermostats like Nest, Ecobee, and Honeywell integrate perfectly with smart home ecosystems. We ensure proper wiring (including the common wire most smart thermostats need) and configure app/voice integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will smart switches slow down my WiFi?",
      "answer": "Individual smart switches use minimal bandwidth. However, many devices on older routers can cause congestion. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices use separate frequencies and don't impact WiFi at all. We can recommend the best approach for your home network."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I still use regular switches after installing smart switches?",
      "answer": "Smart switches can always be operated manually—they're still physical switches. Family members or guests who don't want to use voice or app control can use them exactly like regular switches."
