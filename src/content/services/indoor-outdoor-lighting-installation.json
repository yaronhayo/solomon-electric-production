    {
      "question": "Do you install fixtures I've already purchased?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Bring your own fixtures and we'll install them professionally. We can also help you select fixtures if you haven't decided yet\u2014we're not tied to particular brands and can recommend based on your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add lighting where none exists?",
      "answer": "Yes. We can add new lighting locations, running wire through attics, walls, and crawl spaces. This includes adding switches at convenient locations. Most rooms can have lighting added without major construction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about outdoor lighting in Florida weather?",
      "answer": "All outdoor installations use fixtures and methods rated for wet conditions. We ensure proper weatherproofing, appropriate GFCI protection, and mounting that sheds water. Quality outdoor lighting handles Florida's sun, rain, and humidity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right light fixtures?",
      "answer": "Consider function (ambient, task, accent), style (matching your d\u00e9cor), and light output (appropriate brightness for the space). Dimming capability adds flexibility. We can help you select fixtures appropriate for each space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install heavy chandeliers safely?",
      "answer": "Yes. Heavy fixtures require mounting to ceiling joists or proper brace boxes\u2014not just drywall. We verify structural support and install appropriate mounting hardware for fixtures of any weight."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's under-cabinet lighting and is it worth it?",
      "answer": "Under-cabinet lighting illuminates kitchen countertops\u2014eliminating the shadows that overhead lighting creates when you're working at the counter. It's one of the most functional kitchen upgrades and adds ambiance. Modern LED strips are energy-efficient and long-lasting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install bathroom lighting?",
      "answer": "Yes, with attention to bathroom-specific requirements. Lighting near showers and tubs has wet-location rating requirements. We install vanity lighting, recessed fixtures, and exhaust fan/light combinations with appropriate fixtures and methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can lighting be made dimmable?",
      "answer": "Most lighting can be dimmed with appropriate fixtures and dimmers. LED fixtures require LED-compatible dimmers for smooth operation. We install dimmers that match your fixtures for flicker-free dimming across the full range."
