  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's included in electrical safety certification?",
      "answer": "We inspect: electrical panel (brand, capacity, condition), wiring type and visible condition, outlet testing (grounding, polarity), GFCI function, visible wiring conditions, and general electrical system assessment. Documentation covers all inspected items."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this the same as a 4-point inspection?",
      "answer": "We provide the electrical portion of 4-point inspections. The full 4-point covers roof, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. Some clients need only electrical; others need us as part of complete 4-point coordination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find problems during inspection?",
      "answer": "We document problems objectively. You decide next steps: repair before certification, disclose issues as-is, or understand the situation for planning. We can quote and perform repairs if you choose to address issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does certification take?",
      "answer": "Inspection typically takes 1-2 hours depending on property size. Written certification is usually available within 24-48 hours. Expedited service is available for urgent needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you pass me if my panel is old?",
      "answer": "Age alone doesn't fail inspection. Condition, capacity, and safety matter. Old-but-functional panels can pass. Recalled brands (Federal Pacific, Zinsco) are always noted as concerns. We document accurately what we find."
    },
    {
      "question": "What format is the certification?",
      "answer": "We provide professional certification letters and/or detailed inspection reports. Format can be adapted to specific requirements—insurance forms, real estate formats, or standard certification letters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can certification be updated after repairs?",
      "answer": "Yes. If initial inspection identifies issues and you complete repairs, we can re-inspect and provide updated certification reflecting the corrected condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is certification valid indefinitely?",
      "answer": "Certification documents conditions at time of inspection. Most insurers and buyers accept certifications within the last 6-12 months. Commercial requirements may specify validity periods. We date all certifications clearly."
