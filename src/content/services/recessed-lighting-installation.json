  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How many recessed lights do I need?",
      "answer": "General rule: divide room square footage by 4-6 to get the number of 4-inch lights needed for general illumination. A 12x12 room (144 sq ft) typically needs 6-8 lights. Spacing depends on ceiling height—higher ceilings allow wider spacing. We design layouts customized to your room's specific dimensions and ceiling height."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install recessed lighting without attic access?",
      "answer": "Yes! Retrofit (remodel) recessed fixtures are designed specifically for existing ceilings. They install through small openings cut in the drywall and clip into place without attic access. These work perfectly for single-story homes or rooms below unfinished space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size recessed lights should I use?",
      "answer": "4-inch fixtures are standard for most residential applications—they provide plenty of light without overwhelming smaller ceilings. 6-inch fixtures suit larger rooms, higher ceilings, or areas needing more light output. We'll recommend appropriate sizing for your space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special recessed lights for insulated ceilings?",
      "answer": "Yes. IC-rated (Insulation Contact) fixtures are required when insulation will contact the housing. Standard fixtures require clearance from insulation to prevent fire hazards. We always use IC-rated fixtures unless attic space is uninsulated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can recessed lights be dimmed?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, and we recommend it. Dimmable recessed lighting provides flexibility for any situation. However, LED fixtures require LED-compatible dimmer switches—standard dimmers cause flickering and reduced bulb life. We install proper dimmers with all LED installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about LED vs. traditional recessed lights?",
      "answer": "LED recessed fixtures are the clear winner: they use 75% less energy, last 25,000+ hours (vs 1,000 for incandescent), run cooler, and have dropped to cost parity with older technology. We install LED exclusively unless you specifically request alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does recessed lighting installation take?",
      "answer": "Most residential installations complete in one day. A typical 6-8 light installation in a single room takes 4-6 hours. Larger projects or multiple rooms may extend to a second day. We'll estimate timeline during your consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will installation damage my ceiling?",
      "answer": "We cut precise, clean openings sized to your fixtures—no larger than necessary. Modern retrofit fixtures clip directly into these openings. While cutting ceiling holes is required, the openings are completely covered by trim rings when finished. Touch-up paint may be needed around new switches."
