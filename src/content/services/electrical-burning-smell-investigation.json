    {
      "question": "Is electrical burning smell an emergency?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014treat it as an emergency. Burning smell means overheating is occurring, which can progress to fire. Turn off power if you can identify the source (breaker for that area), and call for investigation. Don't wait until morning or Monday."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does electrical burning smell like?",
      "answer": "Often like burning plastic\u2014acrid and chemical. Sometimes described as 'fishy' or like urine (burning electrical components produce this odd smell). Any unusual burning odor near electrical equipment warrants investigation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I turn off power if I smell burning?",
      "answer": "If you can identify where the smell is coming from, turn off the breaker for that circuit. If the smell is from the panel or you can't locate the source, turn off the main breaker. Don't restore power until the problem is found and fixed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes electrical overheating?",
      "answer": "Common causes: loose connections (most common), overloaded circuits, failing components, damaged wiring, improper installations. All create resistance that converts electricity to heat\u2014potentially enough to ignite fires."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the smell is intermittent?",
      "answer": "Intermittent smell may only occur under load. We investigate under various conditions\u2014lights on, HVAC running, high-use times\u2014to find problems that only appear during specific circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could it be something other than electrical?",
      "answer": "Possibly. HVAC systems, appliances, and other sources can produce burning smells. We help determine whether the source is electrical or point you to appropriate help if it's not."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is thermal imaging inspection?",
      "answer": "Thermal cameras detect heat that's invisible to the eye. Overheating electrical connections show as hot spots. This technology helps us find problems inside walls, panels, and equipment without opening everything up."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find fire damage?",
      "answer": "If we find fire damage\u2014charred wiring, melted components\u2014we document it for insurance, determine extent of damage, and recommend appropriate repairs. Significant hidden fire damage may require insurance claim and major repair work."
