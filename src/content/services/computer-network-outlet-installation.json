  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Cat5e and Cat6?",
      "answer": "Both support gigabit (1000 Mbps) speeds. Cat6 is better shielded, reducing crosstalk, and can support 10 gigabit speeds over shorter distances. Cat6 costs slightly more but provides better future-proofing. For most homes, either works well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is wired network faster than WiFi 6?",
      "answer": "Yes, consistently. WiFi 6 can theoretically match gigabit speeds under ideal conditions, but real-world WiFi rarely achieves theoretical speeds. Wired connections deliver consistent, maximum speeds without WiFi's variability."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many network drops do I need?",
      "answer": "Consider: home office (2), living room TV/gaming (1-2), each bedroom with smart TV (1 each), smart home hub location (1), and any WiFi access point locations (1-2). Most homes benefit from 6-10 drops. More drops cost less per drop when installed together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you run cables to a detached garage or office?",
      "answer": "Yes, with outdoor-rated or conduit-protected cable. For distances over 300 feet, fiber optic connection is recommended. We can connect detached structures with reliable, high-speed network connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should the central network panel be?",
      "answer": "Ideally near where internet service enters your home—often near the electrical panel or utility closet. We install patch panels and leave space for your router and switch equipment in an organized, accessible location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I still need WiFi if I have wired connections?",
      "answer": "Yes—phones, tablets, and many devices use WiFi exclusively. Wired connections are for stationary devices that benefit most: TVs, gaming consoles, desktops, NVRs. Wired access points improve WiFi for mobile devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install during renovation or after?",
      "answer": "Either works. Pre-wire during construction is easier and cheaper. Retrofit installation after construction requires fishing cables through existing walls—more challenging but achievable in most homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you test the cables after installation?",
      "answer": "Yes—every cable is tested for proper termination and speed capability. We verify each run works correctly before finishing. You'll know your network infrastructure is solid."
