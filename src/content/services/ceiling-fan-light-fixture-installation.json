  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I install a ceiling fan where there's only a light fixture?",
      "answer": "Usually, yes—but the existing ceiling box must be replaced with a fan-rated box designed to handle the weight and vibration of a spinning fan. Standard light boxes will fail over time, creating a safety hazard. We install proper fan boxes as part of our fan installation service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install ceiling fans I've already purchased?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Bring your own fixture and we'll install it professionally. We can also help select fixtures if you haven't decided yet—we're not tied to any particular brand and can recommend options based on your needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my ceiling fan wobble?",
      "answer": "Fan wobble comes from unbalanced blades (manufacturing variance or dust accumulation), loose mounting hardware, incorrect installation, or damaged components. We can diagnose and correct wobble issues on existing fans or ensure new installations are balanced from the start."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install a fan on my high/vaulted ceiling?",
      "answer": "Yes. High ceilings often require extended downrods, angled mounting adapters, and proper scaffolding or lift access. We have the equipment and experience to safely install fixtures on any ceiling height."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do ceiling fans reduce cooling bills?",
      "answer": "Yes! Ceiling fans create a wind-chill effect that makes rooms feel 4-8°F cooler. This allows you to raise your thermostat setting and reduce AC runtime. In Florida's long cooling season, this translates to meaningful energy savings—enough that fans typically pay for themselves."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have separate wall switches for fan and light?",
      "answer": "Yes, if proper wiring exists or can be installed. Many older installations have only one switch. We can run additional switch legs, install smart switches that work with single-wire setups, or configure remote controls for separate control."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a fan-rated box and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Fan-rated boxes are designed to support 50+ pounds and withstand the vibration of spinning motors. Standard ceiling boxes are rated for static fixtures (chandeliers, flush mounts) but fail under the dynamic loads of ceiling fans. Using the wrong box is a code violation and safety hazard."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install smart ceiling fans and lights?",
      "answer": "Yes. We install smart fixtures from all major brands, configure apps and voice control, and ensure your smart devices work reliably with your home network. Smart ceiling fans with temperature sensors and scheduling can automate your comfort."
