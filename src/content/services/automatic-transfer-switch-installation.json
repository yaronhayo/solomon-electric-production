  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's an automatic transfer switch?",
      "answer": "An ATS monitors utility power. When it detects an outage, it sends a start signal to your generator. Once the generator is running and stable, it transfers your home's load to generator power\u2014typically within 10-30 seconds. When utility power returns, it transfers back and stops the generator."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ATS work with portable generators?",
      "answer": "Some automatic transfer switches work with portable generators that have electric start. However, most portable generators require manual start, limiting automation. For true automatic operation, a standby generator with remote start capability is recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between whole-house and essential circuit transfer?",
      "answer": "Whole-house ATS powers your entire panel\u2014requiring a generator large enough for all loads. Essential circuit ATS powers only selected circuits (refrigerator, lights, medical equipment) allowing a smaller generator. Most residential installations use essential circuit approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much of my house can an ATS power?",
      "answer": "That depends on your generator size, not the ATS. We size transfer switches for your generator output and select circuits to protect based on available capacity. Larger generators can power more circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a new generator for automatic transfer?",
      "answer": "Automatic transfer works best with standby generators designed for automatic operation. Some portable generators support automatic start with additional equipment. We can assess your current generator and recommend options."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do automatic transfer switches last?",
      "answer": "Quality ATS units last 20+ years with proper maintenance. They're designed for reliable operation over many transfer cycles. Regular testing (running your generator monthly) exercises the transfer mechanism and verifies operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is installation complicated?",
      "answer": "Transfer switch installation involves significant panel work\u2014moving circuits, installing subpanel if needed, connecting generator interface. It's not DIY work. However, for experienced electricians, it's straightforward work that typically completes in one day."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the generator runs out of fuel?",
      "answer": "The ATS continues monitoring. If generator voltage drops (fuel exhausted, mechanical failure), it won't transfer back damaging loads. It will simply wait until either utility returns or generator is restored. Some systems include low-fuel alerts."
