  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What size shore power do I need?",
      "answer": "Most recreational boats use 30A shore power. Larger vessels (40+ feet) often need 50A. Some large yachts require 100A or dual 50A connections. We size shore power based on your boat's electrical system and onboard equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is electric shock drowning?",
      "answer": "ESD occurs when AC current leaks into water near docks and boats. Swimmers or people in the water can be paralyzed by the current and drown. Proper GFCI protection, equipment bonding, and code-compliant installation prevent this deadly hazard."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do docks need GFCI protection?",
      "answer": "GFCIs detect current leakage and trip before dangerous amounts enter water. NEC requires GFCI protection for all dock circuits, and newer codes require equipment ground fault protection (EGFP) for larger circuits. This protection is essential—not optional."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use regular outdoor outlets on my dock?",
      "answer": "No. Dock outlets must be marine-rated and GFCI protected. Standard outdoor outlets corrode quickly and may not withstand dock conditions. We install outlets specifically designed for marine environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I power my boat lift?",
      "answer": "Boat lifts typically need 240V circuits sized for the lift motor. We install appropriately sized circuits with weatherproof disconnects and GFCI protection. Lift manufacturers specify electrical requirements we follow for proper installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about lighting along the dock?",
      "answer": "Dock lighting must be marine-rated for corrosion resistance and installed with GFCI protection. Low-voltage landscape lighting is an option for ambiance, while higher-output fixtures provide safety lighting. We design dock lighting for your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does marine electrical equipment last?",
      "answer": "Quality marine-grade equipment lasts 15-20+ years in saltwater environments. Standard outdoor equipment may fail within 2-3 years. The upfront cost of marine-grade equipment is quickly justified by longevity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do dock electrical installations require permits?",
      "answer": "Yes. Dock electrical work requires permits and inspection like any electrical installation. Some areas have additional regulations for waterfront electrical. We handle permitting and ensure code compliance."
