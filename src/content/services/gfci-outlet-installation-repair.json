  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Where are GFCI outlets required by Florida code?",
      "answer": "Florida requires GFCI protection in bathrooms, kitchens (countertop outlets), garages, outdoors, laundry areas, basements, crawl spaces, pool/spa areas, and within 6 feet of any sink. Requirements have expanded over the years—older homes often lack protection in locations now required by code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a GFCI outlet and a regular outlet?",
      "answer": "A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) constantly monitors current flow, detecting if electricity is escaping through an unintended path (like through a person). When it detects this 'ground fault,' it cuts power in milliseconds—before the current can cause electrocution. Standard outlets provide no such protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my GFCI outlet keep tripping?",
      "answer": "Frequent tripping can indicate: moisture in the outlet or connected devices, a ground fault somewhere on the circuit, damaged wiring, failing appliances, or a worn-out GFCI. We can diagnose the cause and repair the underlying issue rather than just replacing the outlet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can one GFCI outlet protect multiple outlets?",
      "answer": "Yes. A GFCI outlet can protect all 'downstream' outlets wired to its LOAD terminals. This means one GFCI near your panel can protect all bathroom outlets on that circuit. We configure this when it's cost-effective and code-compliant."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I test my GFCI outlets?",
      "answer": "The National Electrical Code recommends monthly testing. Simply press the TEST button—the outlet should trip and cut power. Then press RESET to restore power. If either function fails, the GFCI needs replacement. Most people never test their GFCIs, which is why we recommend annual professional inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are GFCI outlets required for home sale in Florida?",
      "answer": "While Florida doesn't mandate retrofit for home sales, inspectors will note missing GFCI protection in required locations. Buyers often request installation as a condition of sale, and insurance companies may require updates. Proactive installation avoids transaction complications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a GFCI breaker vs. a GFCI outlet?",
      "answer": "A GFCI breaker installs in your electrical panel and protects the entire circuit—useful when you want to protect multiple outlets or hardwired devices. GFCI outlets install at the point of use and can protect downstream outlets. Both provide the same life-saving protection; we'll recommend the best approach for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do outdoor outlets need special GFCI covers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Outdoor GFCI outlets require weatherproof covers that maintain protection even when a cord is plugged in (called 'in-use covers'). Standard flat covers don't meet code for exposed outdoor locations. We install appropriate weatherproof protection with all outdoor GFCI installations."
