    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Level 2 and DC fast charging?",
      "answer": "Level 2 charging uses AC power and adds about 25 miles of range per hour—suitable for destinations where cars park 2+ hours (workplaces, hotels, restaurants). DC fast charging adds 100+ miles in 20-30 minutes—suitable for highway locations and quick-stop retail."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many chargers should we install?",
      "answer": "It depends on your goals and parking size. Start with 2-4% of parking spaces for workplace/retail. Multi-family may need 5-10% initially with plans for expansion. We help you plan appropriate capacity with room for growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What incentives are available for commercial EV charging?",
      "answer": "FPL offers commercial EV infrastructure rebates. Federal tax credits may apply. Some municipalities have additional incentives. We identify all available programs during project planning—incentives often cover 30-50% of installation costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we charge for EV charging?",
      "answer": "Yes. Networked chargers can process payments via app or credit card. You set pricing—free, at-cost, or for profit. Payment systems include monthly reporting on usage and revenue. Free charging is also valid for customer attraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if our electrical service can't handle the additional load?",
      "answer": "Options include: service upgrade (more capacity), load management (smart sharing among chargers), or scheduled charging during low-demand hours. Often load management enables installation without costly service upgrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who pays for electricity when tenants charge?",
      "answer": "You have options: sub-meter and bill tenants, include charging in rent, or use networked chargers that process payments directly. Different approaches suit different properties. We can explain options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do EV chargers require maintenance?",
      "answer": "Minimal. Commercial chargers are designed for durability. Networked stations should be monitored for connectivity issues. Annual inspection is recommended. We offer maintenance services if desired."
    },
    {
      "question": "What brands of chargers do you install?",
      "answer": "We install all major commercial brands—ChargePoint, Enel X, Blink, EvoCharge, and others. Brand selection depends on your needs: networked vs. non-networked, payment capability, warranty, and monitoring features."
