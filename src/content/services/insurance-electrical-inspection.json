    {
      "question": "What is a 4-point inspection?",
      "answer": "Florida's 4-point inspection examines four major home systems: roof, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. Insurers use it to assess risk for older homes. We provide the electrical portion—licensed electrician inspection of your panel, wiring, and safety systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my insurer want an electrical inspection?",
      "answer": "Older homes have higher electrical fire risk—aging wiring, outdated panels, and accumulated wear. Insurers use inspections to identify high-risk situations before insuring or renewing coverage. It protects them from claims on hazardous properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the inspection reveals problems?",
      "answer": "You have options: make repairs before submitting the report, submit the report and address insurer concerns, or find different insurance. We can quote repairs if corrections are needed. Some issues are minor; others may require panel replacement or wiring work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you fail me for an old panel?",
      "answer": "Age alone doesn't fail an inspection—condition matters. However, certain panel brands (Federal Pacific, Zinsco) are known hazards and many insurers require replacement regardless of condition. We document what we find honestly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I get the inspection report?",
      "answer": "We typically provide written reports within 24-48 hours of inspection. If you have urgent insurance deadlines, let us know—we can expedite when necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with my insurer directly?",
      "answer": "We provide the inspection report to you. You submit it to your insurer or insurance agent. We're happy to clarify findings with your insurer if questions arise. Some 4-point inspection companies coordinate multiple trades—we handle the electrical portion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What format is the inspection report?",
      "answer": "We provide detailed written reports with our findings, any concerns, and photographs if required. Most insurers accept our standard format. If your insurer has specific form requirements, we can accommodate those."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you fix problems you find?",
      "answer": "Yes. If we identify issues that need correction for insurance compliance, we can quote and perform those repairs. Many clients prefer one company to handle both inspection and any needed work."
