  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What electrical service do hot tubs require?",
      "answer": "Most hot tubs require 240V, 50-amp service with a 4-wire connection (hot, hot, neutral, ground). Some smaller spas run on 240V/30A. Larger units may need 60 amps. We verify your specific hot tub's requirements—the nameplate or manual specifies exactly what's needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do hot tubs need GFCI protection?",
      "answer": "GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protection detects when electrical current is escaping through an unintended path—like through a person in the water. It cuts power in milliseconds, preventing electrocution. This protection is absolutely mandatory for all hot tub installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the disconnect switch requirement?",
      "answer": "Code requires a lockable disconnect switch within line-of-sight of the hot tub and at least 5 feet away (but no more than 50 feet). This allows quick emergency shutoff if someone is in trouble in the water. We install code-compliant disconnects as part of every hot tub installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I plug a hot tub into a regular outlet?",
      "answer": "Only small plug-and-play spas (120V) can use standard outlets. Full-size hot tubs require 240V hardwired connections—there's no standard outlet for this. We install the complete circuit from panel to spa with required safety devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far can the hot tub be from my electrical panel?",
      "answer": "There's no code limit, but distance affects wire sizing—longer runs require heavier wire to prevent voltage drop. We calculate proper wire gauge for your specific distance. Very long runs (over 100 feet) may benefit from larger wire than minimum requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for hot tub electrical?",
      "answer": "Yes. Hot tub electrical installations require permits in all Florida municipalities. We handle permit applications and inspection scheduling. Never hire an electrician who suggests skipping permits—it's illegal and unsafe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use existing wiring from an old hot tub?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, if the existing circuit is properly sized for the new spa and the wiring is in good condition. However, older installations may not meet current code requirements for GFCI protection or disconnect placement. We assess existing wiring and recommend whether it's usable or needs replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does hot tub wiring installation take?",
      "answer": "Most residential hot tub wiring installations complete in one day—typically 4-6 hours. Underground runs take longer due to trenching. Complex installations or long distances may extend to two days. We'll estimate timeline during your consultation."

Code also requires a disconnect switch within line-of-sight of the spa for emergency shutoff. These aren't optional safety features—they're legally required protections that save lives. South Florida's salt air and humidity cause accelerated corrosion in outdoor and garage outlets. We use corrosion-resistant stainless steel or PVC covers and weather-rated outlets designed for coastal environments."

    {
      "heading": "Proper Wire Sizing for Hot Tubs in South Florida",
      "body": "Hot tub circuits carry significant current over distances from panel to spa. Undersized wire causes voltage drop, overheating, and tripping. We calculate proper wire gauge based on your circuit amperage and distance, ensuring reliable operation and safe wiring. This is especially important for spas located far from the electrical panel. Older South Florida homes often have ungrounded two-prong outlets, aluminum wiring connections, or backstabbed wires—all of which are fire hazards. Our electricians properly diagnose the condition and provide code-compliant solutions."
