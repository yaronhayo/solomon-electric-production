    {
      "question": "Is a small spark when plugging in normal?",
      "answer": "Small, brief sparks when plugging in can be normal—it's the 'load pickup' when electricity starts flowing. However, large sparks, colored sparks (yellow/orange), loud pops, or sparks every time you plug in indicate outlet problems needing attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes outlets to spark?",
      "answer": "Common causes include: loose wiring connections (most common), worn outlet contacts, short circuits in connected equipment, moisture (rare indoors), overloaded circuits, and damaged wiring behind the outlet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I keep using an outlet that sparked?",
      "answer": "If it was a single, brief spark when plugging in a device that works normally, probably okay—but monitor it. If sparking continues, is severe, or happens without touching the outlet, STOP using it immediately and call for service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is sparking from my electrical panel an emergency?",
      "answer": "Yes—absolutely. Any visible sparking from your electrical panel indicates serious problems. Turn off the main breaker immediately (if safe to do so), don't touch the panel, and call for emergency electrical service. Panel arcing can start fires quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does blue vs. orange sparking mean?",
      "answer": "Blue sparks are typically electrical load pickup—often normal. Orange or yellow sparks indicate burning metal or overheating—much more serious. Any colored sparking with heat, smell, or sounds should be treated as an emergency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can loose outlets cause sparking?",
      "answer": "Yes. When outlets become loose in the box or their contacts wear out, plugs don't make solid connections. This intermittent contact causes arcing when plugs move. We can replace worn outlets and secure loose boxes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I smell burning with the sparks?",
      "answer": "Burning smell means overheating is occurring—insulation may already be damaged. Turn off power to the circuit immediately (the breaker, not just unplugging). Call for emergency service. Don't turn power back on until an electrician investigates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need AFCI breakers to prevent arcing?",
      "answer": "AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) breakers detect dangerous arcing and trip before fires start. They're required by code in bedrooms and many living areas. While not required everywhere, AFCIs are an excellent safety upgrade for any home."
