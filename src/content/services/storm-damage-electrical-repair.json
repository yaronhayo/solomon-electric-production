  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to repair a damaged weather head manually?",
      "answer": "No. Working on a service entrance is hazardous due to the presence of high-voltage lines. Repairs must be performed by a licensed professional and inspected prior to use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What parts of the service entrance are the homeowner's responsibility?",
      "answer": "While the utility provider manages the incoming wires, the mast, weather head, and meter base are part of the property's infrastructure and the owner's responsibility to maintain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can outlets that were affected by storm water be reused?",
      "answer": "Equipment that has been exposed to water typically requires replacement to prevent future thermal failure caused by internal corrosion and conductive mineral deposits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is power reconnection managed after a repair?",
      "answer": "Once repairs are completed and have passed a municipal safety inspection, the utility provider is notified that the system is safe to receive power."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are emergency power solutions available during a restoration?",
      "answer": "Transfer switches and interlock kits can be integrated into the panel to allow for the safe use of portable power sources until utility service is restored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I turn off my main breaker during a hurricane?",
      "answer": "If flooding is expected or you evacuate, yes—turn off the main breaker. This prevents damage to your electrical system from surges when power is restored. If you return to standing water near your panel, do not touch it—call a licensed electrician."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does homeowner insurance cover storm electrical damage?",
      "answer": "Most Florida homeowner policies cover electrical damage from named storms, including panel replacement, rewiring, and service mast repair. We provide detailed damage documentation and repair estimates formatted for insurance claim submission."
    },
    {
      "question": "How soon after a storm can electrical repairs begin?",
      "answer": "We begin assessments as soon as conditions are safe. Priority goes to homes with immediate safety hazards—downed service lines, water-damaged panels, and exposed wiring. Non-emergency repairs are typically scheduled within 24-48 hours of the storm passing."
