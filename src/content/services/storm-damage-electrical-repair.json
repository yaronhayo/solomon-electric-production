    {
      "question": "What should I do immediately after a storm damages my electrical system?",
      "answer": "If you see downed power lines, smell burning, see sparking, or suspect water in electrical equipment, don't touch anything—turn off your main breaker if safe to do so and call for emergency electrical service. Never approach downed lines or attempt repairs yourself. Call Solomon Electric for emergency assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will FPL restore power if my service entrance is damaged?",
      "answer": "No. FPL will not restore power to homes with damaged weather heads, service entrances, or meter bases. You need a licensed electrician to repair this equipment and often need a passing inspection before FPL will reconnect service. We handle these repairs and coordinate with FPL."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does homeowner's insurance cover storm electrical damage?",
      "answer": "Most policies cover storm-related electrical damage including service entrance repairs, panel damage, and surge-damaged equipment. Documentation is critical—we photograph all damage and provide detailed repair estimates for your insurance claim. Specific coverage varies by policy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can flooded electrical equipment be saved?",
      "answer": "It depends. Some equipment can be dried, cleaned, and restored. However, panels and outlets that have been submerged typically need replacement—internal components corrode quickly even after drying. We assess each piece of equipment and recommend repair or replacement based on actual condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does storm damage repair take?",
      "answer": "Emergency repairs to restore power often complete in one day. Full restoration of all damaged circuits and equipment may take longer depending on damage extent and material availability. After major hurricanes, material shortages can extend timelines—we maintain storm inventory to minimize delays."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I run my generator until power is restored?",
      "answer": "Portable generators must be properly connected—never through standard outlets which cause dangerous back-feed. If you don't have a transfer switch, we can install one. For post-storm generator safety, keep generators outdoors (carbon monoxide kills), and don't operate in wet conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if only half my house has power after the storm?",
      "answer": "Partial power can indicate several issues: one leg of your service is interrupted, individual circuit damage, or a problem with your panel. This requires professional diagnosis—the cause determines whether you're waiting for FPL or need electrician repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I prepare my electrical system for future storms?",
      "answer": "We recommend: whole-home surge protection (for lightning), properly installed transfer switch (for generator), secured weather head and service entrance, and tree trimming away from service lines. We can assess your system's storm vulnerability and recommend improvements."
