  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is my specific panel brand a problem?",
      "answer": "Federal Pacific (FPE/Stab-Lok) and Zinsco breakers have documented failure rates—they don't trip when they should, leading to overheating and fires. The problem is the breaker design, not just age. These panels should be replaced regardless of condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I have a recalled panel?",
      "answer": "Look for 'Federal Pacific,' 'FPE,' 'Stab-Lok,' 'Zinsco,' or 'Sylvania Zinsco' on the panel door or breakers. Not sure? Send us a photo and we'll identify it. These brands are easily recognizable to electricians."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my insurance cover panel replacement?",
      "answer": "Insurance typically doesn't cover replacement of functioning but hazardous panels—that's maintenance, not damage. However, if your insurer requires replacement for continued coverage, the alternative is losing insurance. The cost of replacement versus uninsured status makes the decision clear."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does panel replacement take?",
      "answer": "Typically one full day for direct replacement (same size panel). Power is off for most of that time—usually 6-10 hours. We coordinate to minimize disruption and complete work efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I upgrade size while replacing?",
      "answer": "If your panel is being replaced anyway, upgrading from 100A to 200A adds relatively little to the project (vs. separate upgrade later). Consider future needs—EV charging, additions, modern electrical loads. We can advise whether upgrade makes sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about my breakers?",
      "answer": "Panel replacement includes new breakers. Old breakers don't fit new panels, and you wouldn't want problematic breakers in a new panel anyway. All new equipment provides the fresh start replacement is meant to achieve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will replacement solve my electrical problems?",
      "answer": "Panel replacement addresses panel-specific issues—recalled equipment, corrosion, physical damage. If you have wiring problems, overloaded circuits, or other issues, those may need separate attention. We identify what panel replacement will and won't solve."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to coordinate with FPL?",
      "answer": "We handle FPL coordination. Panel replacement typically requires FPL to briefly disconnect and reconnect the meter. We schedule this as part of the project. You don't need to contact FPL directly."
