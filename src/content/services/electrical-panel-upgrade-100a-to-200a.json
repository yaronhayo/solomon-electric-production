  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is an upgrade required for insurance purposes?",
      "answer": "Insurance carriers in Florida prioritize safety and have identified older electrical panels as higher risk for claims. A 200-amp modernization is often the standard requirement for maintaining full property coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is service interrupted during the upgrade?",
      "answer": "Yes, electrical service is temporarily disconnected during the physical transfer of the service entrance and panel and is restored following municipal inspection approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between legacy and modern panels?",
      "answer": "Modern panels offer higher amperage capacity and advanced circuit protection technology that was not available in older models, ensuring the system can handle current home loads safely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are older panel brands still considered functional?",
      "answer": "While they may deliver power, certain legacy brands have a high failure rate in critical safety tests and are no longer recommended for continued use in residential settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is surge protection included in a panel upgrade?",
      "answer": "Current Florida building codes often require the integration of surge protection during a panel modernization to safeguard the electrical system from internal and external voltage spikes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a panel upgrade from 100A to 200A take?",
      "answer": "Most residential panel upgrades are completed in one day, typically 6 to 8 hours. This includes coordination with FPL for the meter disconnect and reconnect, installing the new panel, and transferring all circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for a panel upgrade in {cityName}?",
      "answer": "Yes. Florida requires electrical permits for panel upgrades. We handle the entire permit process—application, scheduling the inspection, and ensuring the installation passes on the first visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my power be out during the entire upgrade?",
      "answer": "Power is typically off for 4 to 6 hours during the main installation phase. We coordinate with FPL to minimize downtime and can arrange temporary power if needed for medical equipment or other critical loads."

      "body": "Most {cityName} homes built before 2000 have 100-amp panels that weren't designed for today's electrical demands. EV chargers, modern HVAC systems, pool equipment, and home offices can easily overload older panels. Upgrading to 200 amps provides the capacity your home needs safely and prevents dangerous overloading. Insurance companies increasingly require panel upgrades for policy renewals. Our electricians provide documented before-and-after reports that satisfy insurance requirements, and we coordinate directly with your insurer when needed."

      "heading": "Seamless {cityName} Panel Upgrades: What to Expect",
      "body": "A professional panel upgrade involves more than swapping a box. Our licensed electricians assess your current wiring, calculate total load requirements, coordinate FPL meter services, install a modern breaker panel with room for expansion, and ensure everything passes county inspection the first time. Modern electrical demands—EV chargers, home offices, pool equipment, smart home systems—require more capacity than panels installed even 15 years ago. We future-proof your installation with 20-30% additional capacity beyond your current needs."
