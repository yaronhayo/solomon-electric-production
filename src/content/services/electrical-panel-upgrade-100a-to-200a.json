  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Does my Miami home need a 200-amp panel upgrade?",
      "answer": "If your home still has a fuse box, a Federal Pacific (FPE) or Zinsco panel, or if your breakers trip frequently when using appliances, you likely need an upgrade. Insurance companies often require replacing panels older than 30 years. If you're planning to add an EV charger, pool pump, or additional AC unit, 200-amp service is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a panel upgrade take?",
      "answer": "Most residential panel upgrades from 100A to 200A are completed in one day—typically 6-8 hours from FPL disconnect to power restoration. We coordinate with FPL to minimize your outage time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I need a permit for a new electrical panel?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Florida law requires permits for panel changes. We handle all permit applications with your local building department (Miami-Dade, Broward, or municipal) and coordinate the required inspection. Never hire an electrician who suggests skipping permits—it's illegal and can void your insurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much capacity do I need for an EV charger?",
      "answer": "Level 2 EV chargers typically require a 40-50 amp circuit. With a 200-amp panel, you'll have plenty of capacity for EV charging plus future additions. We can install your EV charger circuit during the panel upgrade for maximum efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's wrong with Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels?",
      "answer": "These panel brands have documented failure rates where breakers don't trip during overcurrent conditions—the exact moment they're supposed to protect your home from fire. While not officially recalled, they're widely considered fire hazards. Most insurance companies require replacement. We recommend upgrading these panels regardless of age."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does FPL need to be involved in my panel upgrade?",
      "answer": "Yes. Panel upgrades require FPL to disconnect power, install a new meter base, and reconnect service. We coordinate all FPL scheduling as part of our service—you don't need to make separate arrangements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will upgrading my panel increase my electricity bill?",
      "answer": "No. A larger panel doesn't use more electricity—it simply provides more capacity for when you need it. Your bill is based on consumption, not panel size. In fact, if you're currently causing breakers to trip and then running extra cycles on appliances, you might actually see slight savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you upgrade my panel if I live in a condo?",
      "answer": "Condo panel upgrades are more complex because they involve HOA approval, building electrical infrastructure, and sometimes FPL coordination for the entire building. We specialize in South Florida condo electrical work and can assess whether an upgrade is possible in your situation."

Year-round air conditioning, pool pumps, dehumidifiers, and hurricane season power needs quickly overwhelm 100-amp panels that were standard in homes built before 2000. Add an EV charger, home office equipment, or kitchen renovation, and you'll exceed safe capacity. Upgrading to 200 amps eliminates these constraints while adding modern safety features."
