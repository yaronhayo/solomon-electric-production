      "question": "Is service interrupted during the upgrade?",
      "answer": "Yes, electrical service is temporarily disconnected during the physical transfer of the service entrance and panel and is restored following municipal inspection approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between legacy and modern panels?",
      "answer": "Modern panels offer higher amperage capacity and advanced circuit protection technology that was not available in older models, ensuring the system can handle current home loads safely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are older panel brands still considered functional?",
      "answer": "While they may deliver power, certain legacy brands have a high failure rate in critical safety tests and are no longer recommended for continued use in residential settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is surge protection included in a panel upgrade?",
      "answer": "Current Florida building codes often require the integration of surge protection during a panel modernization to safeguard the electrical system from internal and external voltage spikes."
