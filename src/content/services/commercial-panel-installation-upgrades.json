  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my commercial panel needs upgrading?",
      "answer": "Signs include: frequent breaker trips, panel at full capacity (no room for new circuits), planning to add significant equipment or HVAC, panel over 25 years old, or utility company flagging capacity issues. We can perform a load analysis to determine if upgrading makes sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between single-phase and three-phase service?",
      "answer": "Single-phase service (common in smaller commercial) delivers power on two hot wires. Three-phase service uses three hot wires, providing more power delivery and the ability to run three-phase motors directly. Larger commercial equipment often requires three-phase power."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will installation take and will I lose power?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends on project scope—simple panel changeouts may take a day, while service upgrades with utility work extend to weeks. Some work requires planned outages, but we minimize duration and often work during off-hours. We provide detailed schedules before starting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do commercial panels require permits?",
      "answer": "Yes. All commercial electrical work in Florida requires permits and inspections. We handle all permitting and inspection coordination, ensuring your installation is legal and meets all code requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add a subpanel instead of replacing my main panel?",
      "answer": "Often, yes. If your main panel has capacity but no physical space for new breakers, a subpanel provides additional circuit space. However, if the main panel itself is at capacity, a subpanel doesn't help—you need a main panel upgrade."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about generator connections for my business?",
      "answer": "Commercial generator installations require transfer switches integrated with your panel system. We can configure panels for generator connection, install automatic transfer switches, and ensure your critical circuits receive backup power during outages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with FPL on service upgrades?",
      "answer": "Yes. Commercial service upgrades require utility coordination—FPL must upgrade transformers, meters, and service drops for larger service sizes. We manage this coordination as part of our service, handling communication with FPL and scheduling their work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size panel does my business need?",
      "answer": "Panel sizing depends on your electrical load—HVAC, lighting, equipment, and future growth plans. Common commercial sizes range from 200-800 amps (or larger for industrial). We perform load calculations to determine the right size for your specific needs."
