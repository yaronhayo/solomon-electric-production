  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How early should electrical be involved in build-out planning?",
      "answer": "As early as possible. Electrical decisions affect overall layout, and we can identify potential issues or cost drivers before plans are finalized. Ideally, we review plans during design\u2014not after permit submission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work from architectural plans or do you design electrical?",
      "answer": "Either approach works. We can work from architect-provided electrical plans or design electrical systems ourselves based on architectural floor plans and tenant requirements. Many build-outs use our design services for electrical-specific expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does build-out electrical work take?",
      "answer": "It depends on space size and complexity. Small retail spaces might take 1-2 weeks. Larger restaurant or office build-outs take 3-6 weeks. We provide realistic schedules during estimation and meet committed timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle permit inspections?",
      "answer": "Yes. We coordinate required inspections, are present when inspectors arrive, and address any concerns. Passing inspection is our responsibility\u2014we don't leave that to you or the GC."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about IT and data wiring?",
      "answer": "We install data infrastructure\u2014network cable runs, data jacks, server room wiring. We coordinate with tenant's IT vendor for specific requirements. Modern offices typically need data drops at every workstation location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work nights/weekends to avoid disruption?",
      "answer": "Yes. For build-outs in occupied buildings, we can schedule noisy work during off-hours. For tenant move-in deadlines, we can work extended hours to meet schedules. We accommodate project needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who's responsible if existing building infrastructure is inadequate?",
      "answer": "We identify infrastructure limitations during assessment. If building electrical can't support tenant needs, we'll specify necessary upgrades. Responsibility for building-side upgrades is typically clarified in tenant leases\u2014we work with both parties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide warranty on build-out work?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our work includes standard warranty coverage. Equipment and fixtures carry manufacturer warranties. If issues arise after occupancy, we stand behind our work."
