  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between occupancy and vacancy sensors?",
      "answer": "Occupancy sensors turn lights ON automatically when you enter and OFF when you leave. Vacancy sensors require manual ON (you flip the switch) but turn OFF automatically when you leave. Vacancy sensors are often preferred for bedrooms and living areas where you want control over when lights come on."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will motion sensors work with my existing light fixtures?",
      "answer": "Yes. Motion sensor switches replace your wall switch and work with any fixture. They're rated for specific total wattages—we ensure your fixture load is within the switch rating. LED lighting works perfectly with modern occupancy sensors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't all LED bulbs work with dimmers?",
      "answer": "LED bulbs contain drivers (electronics) that must be designed for dimming. Non-dimmable LEDs can flicker, buzz, or fail with dimmers. Always use bulbs marked 'dimmable' with dimmer switches—and use dimmers rated for LED loads. We can recommend compatible combinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "My dimmer buzzes—what's wrong?",
      "answer": "Buzzing typically indicates incompatibility between the dimmer and bulbs. Common causes: old-style dimmers with LED bulbs, dimmers operating near minimum load, or incompatible LED drivers. The solution is usually replacing the dimmer with one designed for your specific bulb type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can motion sensors be adjusted?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most occupancy sensors have adjustments for sensitivity (how much motion triggers them), time delay (how long lights stay on after motion stops), and sometimes ambient light (preventing daytime activation). We set these during installation and can show you how to adjust them later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will motion sensors activate from pet movement?",
      "answer": "PIR (passive infrared) sensors can detect larger pets, especially if they're close to the sensor or furniture. Ceiling-mounted sensors and adjustable sensitivity settings help minimize pet triggers. We can position sensors and adjust settings to reduce unwanted activations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install dimmers for ceiling fans?",
      "answer": "Regular dimmers should never be used with ceiling fans—they damage fan motors. Fan speed controls are specifically designed for fans. We install appropriate controls: dimmers for lights only, fan controls for fans, or combination units that control both independently."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do motion sensors save on electricity?",
      "answer": "Savings depend on how often lights were left on unnecessarily. In areas where lights run frequently when unoccupied (closets, bathrooms, garages), sensors can reduce lighting energy by 30-60%. The savings typically pay for the sensors within 1-2 years."
