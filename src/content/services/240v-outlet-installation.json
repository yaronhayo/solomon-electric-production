  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between 120V and 240V?",
      "answer": "Standard outlets provide 120V for typical household devices. 240V uses both legs of your electrical service to provide double the voltage for high-power equipment. Heavy-duty appliances use 240V because it allows the same power with less current, enabling smaller wire sizes and reduced heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of 240V outlet do I need?",
      "answer": "The outlet type depends on your equipment. NEMA 14-30 (30-amp) is standard for electric dryers. NEMA 14-50 (50-amp) is used for ranges and EV chargers. NEMA 6-50 (50-amp, no neutral) is common for welders. We verify your equipment's requirements and install the correct outlet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my panel have room for a 240V circuit?",
      "answer": "240V circuits require double-pole breakers taking two adjacent spaces. Many panels have open spaces, but capacity also depends on your overall electrical load. We assess your panel during consultation and discuss options if upgrades are needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far can 240V outlets be from the panel?",
      "answer": "Distance affects wire gauge requirements\u2014longer runs require heavier wire to prevent voltage drop. We calculate proper wire sizes for your specific installation, ensuring full voltage reaches your equipment regardless of distance from the panel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do 240V circuits need GFCI protection?",
      "answer": "Some do. 240V outlets in garages, outdoors, and within 6 feet of water sources require GFCI protection per current code. Hot tub and pool equipment have specific GFCI requirements. We install appropriate protection for each location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I convert a gas dryer connection to electric?",
      "answer": "You'll need a new electrical circuit\u2014there's no way to convert existing gas piping to electrical. We install the 240V, 30-amp circuit required for electric dryers, including proper outlet placement where your dryer will be located."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have an old 3-prong dryer outlet?",
      "answer": "Older 3-prong dryer outlets (NEMA 10-30) lack a ground wire\u2014a safety concern. Modern dryers require 4-prong outlets (NEMA 14-30) with separate neutral and ground. We can upgrade your outlet and circuit to current standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install 240V in a detached garage or workshop?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We run 240V circuits to detached buildings using properly sized underground or overhead feeders. Workshops often need multiple 240V circuits for different tools. We design systems to handle your current needs plus future expansion."
