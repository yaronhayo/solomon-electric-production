  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why does my breaker keep tripping?",
      "answer": "Common causes include: circuit overload (too many devices), short circuit (damaged wire or appliance), ground fault (especially in wet areas), failing breaker, or loose connections. We diagnose the specific cause rather than just resetting repeatedly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I just replace a breaker myself?",
      "answer": "While technically possible, panel work is dangerous\u2014live bus bars can kill. Breakers must also match your panel brand exactly. Wrong breakers can fail to trip properly and cause fires. We strongly recommend professional replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my breaker trip immediately when I reset it?",
      "answer": "Immediate tripping indicates a short circuit (hot wire touching neutral or ground) or ground fault on that circuit. Something on that circuit has a serious wiring problem. Don't keep trying\u2014the breaker is protecting you. Call for diagnosis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are arc fault breakers and do I need them?",
      "answer": "Arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) detect dangerous arcing that can cause fires\u2014even when current is too low to trip standard breakers. Current code requires AFCIs in bedrooms and many living areas. They're an excellent safety upgrade for older homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "My panel has rust/corrosion\u2014is that dangerous?",
      "answer": "Rust indicates moisture intrusion, which is serious in electrical panels. Corrosion can affect connections and breaker operation. Depending on severity, you may need repairs or panel replacement. We can assess the damage and recommend appropriate action."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can breakers wear out?",
      "answer": "Yes. Breakers are mechanical devices that can fail after years of use or repeated tripping. A breaker that trips more easily than it used to, won't stay on, or runs warm may need replacement. Quality circuit breakers last 25-30 years under normal conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do breakers from the hardware store sometimes not fit my panel?",
      "answer": "Breakers must match your panel brand and series. While breakers may physically fit, incorrect breakers don't make proper contact with bus bars, can fail to trip, and violate code. We use manufacturer-appropriate breakers for your specific panel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is a burning smell from the panel an emergency?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014absolutely. A burning smell indicates overheating, which can cause fire. Turn off the main breaker immediately (if safe to do so), leave the area if smoke is visible, and call for emergency electrical service. Don't ignore this warning sign."
