  "description": "South Florida's hurricane season brings extended power outages that can last days or even weeks. A standby generator starts automatically within seconds of a power failure, keeping your AC, refrigerator, medical equipment, and security system running. When the power goes out in South Florida—from hurricanes, thunderstorms, or grid failures—a whole-home standby generator keeps your family safe and comfortable. Unlike portable generators, standby systems detect outages automatically and restore power within seconds, running on natural gas or propane so you never have to worry about fuel supplies. Solomon Electric's licensed electricians provide complete generator installation including sizing, permits, and professional installation.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What size generator do I need for my home?",
      "answer": "Generator sizing depends on what you want to power during outages. A 16-22kW unit typically handles essentials (AC, refrigerator, lights, some outlets). Whole-home coverage for larger homes may require 24kW or larger. We perform a detailed load calculation to recommend the right size—oversizing wastes money, undersizing leaves you without critical power."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long can a standby generator run continuously?",
      "answer": "Standby generators can run indefinitely as long as fuel is available. Natural gas units connected to utility gas have unlimited runtime. Propane units run until the tank empties (a 500-gallon tank provides roughly 7-10 days at moderate load). Generators need oil changes every 200-500 hours of operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do standby generators require permits in Florida?",
      "answer": "Yes. Generator installations require electrical permits (for the transfer switch) and often gas permits (for fuel line connections). Some municipalities have additional requirements. Solomon Electric handles all permitting—you don't need to coordinate anything yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "How loud are whole-home generators?",
      "answer": "Modern standby generators operate at 65-75 decibels—about the volume of a conversation or air conditioner compressor. They're significantly quieter than portable generators and designed for residential neighborhoods. Local codes specify setback requirements from property lines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Natural gas vs. propane—which is better?",
      "answer": "If you have natural gas service, it's typically the better choice—unlimited fuel supply and no tank to maintain. Propane is excellent for homes without gas lines; we can install propane tanks sized to your expected usage. Both fuels provide reliable, clean-burning operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do generators need maintenance?",
      "answer": "Standby generators self-test weekly (you'll hear them run briefly) to ensure readiness. Professional maintenance is recommended annually—oil change, filter replacement, battery check, and load testing. We offer maintenance plans to keep your investment ready when you need it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my generator power my air conditioning?",
      "answer": "Yes, with properly sized equipment. Air conditioning is typically the largest electrical load in Florida homes. We size your generator specifically to handle your AC system(s) plus other essential circuits. Running without AC during hot, humid post-hurricane recovery is miserable—we make sure you're comfortable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What brands of generators do you install?",
      "answer": "We install Generac, Kohler, and Briggs & Stratton generators—all major brands with proven reliability and available parts/service. We'll recommend the best unit for your specific needs, budget, and home requirements."
