    {
      "question": "How does 'Cascading' protection work?",
      "answer": "Cascading involves placing a primary protector at the main electrical panel and secondary protectors at sensitive equipment outlets. This creates a multi-layered defense against high-voltage events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can surge protection handle a direct lightning strike?",
      "answer": "While direct strikes involve immense energy, a properly grounded SPD system significantly reduces the associated fire hazard and helps protecting the home's primary electrical components."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is protection recommended for air conditioning units?",
      "answer": "Modern AC units utilize electronic control boards that are highly sensitive to voltage fluctuations. Protection at the panel helps safeguard these components from induced surges."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can one verify the status of the surge protector?",
      "answer": "Commercial-grade SPDs feature visual indicator lights. A change in the indicator status signifies that the device has responded to a high-voltage event and may require replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is professional installation required?",
      "answer": "Yes, installing a panel-mounted SPD requires access to the main service panel and must be performed by a licensed electrician to ensure proper bonding and site safety."
