  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need whole-home surge protection if I use power strips?",
      "answer": "Power strip surge protectors provide a second layer of defense, but they can't protect everything—especially hardwired devices like your HVAC system, water heater, and built-in appliances. They also degrade over time and often fail without warning. Whole-home protection at your panel stops surges before they reach any outlet."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does whole-home surge protection work?",
      "answer": "A surge protective device (SPD) installed at your electrical panel monitors incoming voltage. When it detects a dangerous spike, it instantly diverts the excess energy to your home's grounding system—protecting everything connected to your electrical system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will surge protection help during a lightning strike on my house?",
      "answer": "A direct lightning strike to your home involves massive energy that no residential equipment can fully stop—though whole-home protection will significantly reduce damage even in direct strikes. However, most lightning damage comes from nearby strikes (within a mile or more) that induce surges through power lines—and this is exactly what surge protection handles."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does whole-home surge protection last?",
      "answer": "Quality surge protectors last 5-10 years under normal conditions, though multiple significant surge events will reduce lifespan. Most units include LED indicators showing protection status. We recommend annual inspection during your electrical system checkup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does my homeowner's insurance require surge protection?",
      "answer": "Most policies don't require it, but many insurers offer premium discounts for documented whole-home surge protection installation. After a major surge event, some insurers add surge protection requirements for continued coverage. Check with your agent about available discounts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What joule rating do I need for Florida?",
      "answer": "Given Florida's extreme lightning activity, we recommend SPDs with minimum 50,000-amp surge current ratings and joule ratings of 1,000 or higher. Consumer-grade units with 400-600 joule ratings provide minimal protection against lightning-induced surges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install surge protection during a panel upgrade?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—this is the ideal time! Installing surge protection during a panel upgrade means only one installation visit and ensures your new panel is protected from day one. We offer package pricing for panel upgrades with surge protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my grounding system important for surge protection?",
      "answer": "Critical. Surge protection works by diverting dangerous voltage to ground. Poor grounding means surges have nowhere to go. We verify your grounding system during installation and make any necessary improvements to ensure effective protection."

They can't protect hardwired devices, they degrade invisibly over time, and they don't have the capacity to handle significant surges. Whole-home surge protection installed at your electrical panel protects every outlet, every appliance, and every circuit—including your air conditioning system."

Your HVAC system alone contains electronic control boards that cost hundreds to replace. One lightning-induced surge can cause more damage than a decade of surge protection costs."
