  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you correct violations?",
      "answer": "It depends on severity and parts availability. Simple violations (missing covers, GFCI installation) can be corrected rapidly. Complex violations (panel replacement, rewiring) take longer. We prioritize based on your deadline."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't understand the violation notice?",
      "answer": "Inspection reports can be technical and confusing. We interpret violation notices, explain what they mean, and clarify what corrections are needed. Understanding the problem is the first step."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with fire marshal violations?",
      "answer": "Yes. Fire code violations related to electrical—exit signs, emergency lighting, panel access—fall within our expertise. We address fire code electrical violations and coordinate with fire inspectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about commercial violations?",
      "answer": "Commercial violations are often more complex and have stricter deadlines. We handle commercial violation repairs with appropriate urgency and can work extended hours to meet certificate of occupancy deadlines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you coordinate re-inspection?",
      "answer": "Yes. After corrections, we schedule re-inspection, are present when the inspector arrives, and address any remaining concerns. Our goal is passed re-inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documentation do I receive?",
      "answer": "We provide work documentation describing corrections made, along with passed re-inspection records if applicable. This documentation satisfies insurers, title companies, and your records."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can violations be 'grandfathered'?",
      "answer": "Some conditions that were legal when installed remain legal (grandfathered). However, safety hazards and clearly substandard work typically require correction regardless. We clarify what applies to your specific violations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if corrections are expensive?",
      "answer": "We provide accurate quotes before starting work. For expensive corrections, we discuss options—phased work, alternative approaches, or understanding whether the violation truly requires correction. We help you make informed decisions."
