  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's an interlock kit vs. a transfer switch?",
      "answer": "Both prevent back-feed. Interlock kits are plates that mechanically prevent your main breaker and generator breaker from being on simultaneously—more affordable but requires manual breaker operation. Transfer switches are separate panels where you flip circuits between utility and generator—more convenient but higher cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many circuits can my portable generator power?",
      "answer": "It depends on generator size and what you want to run. A typical 7,500-watt generator can power refrigerator, well pump, several lights, and some outlets—but not central AC. We calculate loads and help you select circuits that fit your generator's capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't I just plug my generator into an outlet?",
      "answer": "This creates dangerous back-feed—power flows backward through your panel onto utility lines. Utility workers assume downed lines are dead and can be electrocuted by your generator. It's illegal, dangerous, and can damage your equipment when utility power returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What size inlet box do I need?",
      "answer": "Inlet box amperage should match your generator's 240V output. A 30-amp inlet is common for mid-size generators (5,000-7,500 watts). Larger generators may need 50-amp inlets. We match inlet size to your specific generator."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I power my central AC with a portable generator?",
      "answer": "Only with a large generator—typically 10,000+ watts for a 3-ton AC system. Most portable generators can't handle central AC startup loads. We calculate whether your generator can handle AC or if you should prioritize other loads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for generator hookup installation?",
      "answer": "Generally yes—it's electrical work affecting your panel. Permits ensure proper installation and inspection. We handle permit applications and inspection coordination as part of our standard installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should the inlet box be located?",
      "answer": "The inlet box should be near where you'll position your generator—typically on an exterior wall close to the panel. It needs easy access but protection from weather. We'll identify the optimal location for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I operate the generator hookup safely?",
      "answer": "The sequence: 1) Position generator outdoors with exhaust away from home, 2) Turn off main breaker, 3) Turn off all circuit breakers, 4) Connect generator cord to inlet, 5) Start generator, 6) Turn on generator breaker, 7) Turn on selected circuit breakers. We'll demonstrate this during installation."
