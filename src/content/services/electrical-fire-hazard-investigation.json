  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What electrical conditions cause fires?",
      "answer": "Common fire causes: loose connections creating heat, overloaded circuits exceeding wire ratings, degraded wire insulation, recalled panels (Federal Pacific, Zinsco), improper DIY installations, and damages from pests or physical contact."
    },
    {
      "question": "How common are electrical fires?",
      "answer": "Electrical problems cause approximately 47,000 home fires annually in the US, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Most are preventable—caused by conditions that proper inspection could identify and remediate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a thermal imaging inspection?",
      "answer": "Thermal cameras detect heat that's invisible to the eye. Overheating electrical connections show as hot spots on thermal images. This non-invasive technology identifies problems inside panels, walls, and equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my old panel a fire hazard?",
      "answer": "Age alone doesn't make panels hazardous, but certain brands (Federal Pacific, Zinsco) have documented fire risks regardless of age. Very old panels may also have degraded components or inadequate capacity. We assess actual condition, not just age."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about aluminum wiring?",
      "answer": "Aluminum branch circuit wiring (1965-1975 era) presents fire risks at connections—aluminum expands/contracts differently than the copper/brass fittings it connects to. It doesn't require removal, but connections need proper treatment or replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can DIY electrical work cause fires?",
      "answer": "Yes. Common DIY mistakes include: improper wire sizing, loose connections, overloaded circuits, inappropriate wire types, missing junction boxes, and connections not tightened properly. We identify and document these hazards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if you find serious hazards?",
      "answer": "We'll explain the severity and recommend immediate actions—potentially shutting off specific circuits until repairs are complete. For serious hazards, we provide same-day or next-day repair availability. Your safety is the priority."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does investigation damage walls or finishes?",
      "answer": "Our inspection techniques are largely non-invasive. Thermal imaging sees through walls without holes. Panel inspection opens the panel cover but doesn't affect your home. If destructive investigation is needed, we discuss it first."
