  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need a C-wire for a smart thermostat?",
      "answer": "Most smart thermostats need a C-wire (common wire) for power. Many older thermostats don't use this wire even if it's present at the air handler. We check your wiring and can install a C-wire if needed, or recommend thermostats with battery backup (like some Nest models) or adapter solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Nest, Ecobee, and Honeywell?",
      "answer": "All are excellent choices with similar capabilities. Nest has the sleekest interface and strong learning features. Ecobee includes room sensors for better temperature balancing. Honeywell offers broad HVAC compatibility and familiar interface. We can help you choose based on your priorities and HVAC system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a smart thermostat work with my HVAC system?",
      "answer": "Most smart thermostats work with common HVAC systems: central AC, heat pumps, furnaces, and many multi-stage systems. Some very old systems, high-voltage systems (like baseboard heat), and some proprietary HVAC equipment may have compatibility limitations. We verify compatibility before installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I save with a smart thermostat?",
      "answer": "Studies show 10-15% HVAC energy savings from smart thermostats. In Florida where AC accounts for a large portion of electricity bills, this translates to meaningful monthly savings. Exact savings depend on your current habits and home efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can smart thermostats be controlled by voice?",
      "answer": "Yes! All major smart thermostats integrate with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and most work with Apple HomeKit. You can say 'Alexa, set the temperature to 74' or 'Hey Google, turn on AC.' We configure voice assistant integration during installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my power goes out?",
      "answer": "Smart thermostats typically have battery backup that maintains settings during outages. When power returns, they reconnect to WiFi and resume normal operation. Your schedule and preferences aren't lost during power disruptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install a smart thermostat myself?",
      "answer": "While some handy homeowners can handle basic installation, professional installation ensures: proper wiring (including C-wire installation if needed), correct HVAC configuration, complete app and voice setup, and verification that all heating/cooling modes work correctly. DIY mistakes can damage HVAC equipment or void warranties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do smart thermostats work with multi-zone systems?",
      "answer": "Yes. Homes with multiple AC zones need a thermostat for each zone. We install and configure multi-thermostat setups where multiple smart thermostats work together, often controlled through a single app. Ecobee and Nest both support this configuration well."
