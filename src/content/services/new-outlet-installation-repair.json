  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to add an outlet?",
      "answer": "Cost varies based on location, distance from existing circuits, and whether new circuits are needed. Adding an outlet to an existing circuit with accessible routing is relatively economical. Dedicated circuits or long wire runs cost more. We provide upfront pricing after assessing your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add an outlet to a specific wall location?",
      "answer": "Usually, yes! We can add outlets to most wall locations by routing wiring through attics, crawl spaces, or along existing wire paths. Some locations (exterior walls with insulation, concrete walls, inaccessible areas) are more challenging but usually still possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to add an outlet?",
      "answer": "Florida generally requires permits for new electrical circuits but not always for extending existing circuits with additional outlets. Either way, professional installation ensures code compliance. We'll advise whether permitting is required for your specific project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are USB outlets and should I get them?",
      "answer": "USB outlets include built-in USB-A or USB-C charging ports alongside standard receptacles. They're convenient for charging phones and tablets without taking outlet space for adapters. We recommend them in bedrooms, offices, and kitchen charging areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do plugs fall out of my outlets?",
      "answer": "Outlet contacts wear over time, losing their grip on plugs. This creates loose connections that can arc and cause fires. Outlets with poor plug retention should be replaced\u2014it's a straightforward repair that eliminates a real hazard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a dedicated circuit and when do I need one?",
      "answer": "A dedicated circuit serves only one outlet or appliance rather than being shared. You need dedicated circuits for: refrigerators, microwaves, garbage disposals, dishwashers, washers/dryers, garage door openers, and any appliance over 1000 watts. Dedicated circuits prevent overloading."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add an outlet behind my mounted TV?",
      "answer": "Absolutely\u2014this is one of our most popular requests. We install recessed outlet boxes with cable pass-through designed specifically for wall-mounted TVs. This eliminates visible cords for a clean, professional look."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between 15-amp and 20-amp outlets?",
      "answer": "20-amp outlets handle more current and are required for certain circuits (kitchens, laundry, bathrooms). They have a distinctive T-shaped slot for 20-amp plugs. Most general-purpose outlets are 15-amp. We'll install the appropriate type based on the circuit and location."
