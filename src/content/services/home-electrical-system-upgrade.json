    {
      "question": "How do I know if my home needs an electrical system upgrade?",
      "answer": "Look for warning signs like frequent breaker trips, flickering lights, two-prong outlets, warm or discolored outlets, burning smells, or if your home was built before 1980. We offer free electrical assessments to evaluate your system's condition and safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a complete home electrical upgrade take?",
      "answer": "Timeline depends on the scope of work. Minor upgrades may take 1-2 days, while complete rewiring of an older home can take 3-5 days. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your consultation and work to minimize disruption to your daily life."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need permits for electrical upgrade work in South Florida?",
      "answer": "Yes, most electrical work in South Florida requires permits. Solomon Electric handles all permit applications, coordinates inspections, and provides final documentation. Never hire an electrician who suggests skipping permits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is aluminum wiring dangerous? Should I replace it?",
      "answer": "Aluminum wiring installed in the 1960s-70s can be a fire hazard due to oxidation and loose connections at terminals. We can either replace aluminum wiring with copper or install approved aluminum-to-copper connectors (COPALUM or AlumiConn) as a safe alternative."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will upgrading my electrical system save money on my electric bill?",
      "answer": "While the primary benefits are safety and capacity, modern electrical systems with LED-compatible dimmers, smart controls, and efficient wiring can contribute to energy savings. The bigger savings come from avoiding costly emergency repairs and potential fire damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you upgrade my electrical system if I'm planning a renovation?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—this is the ideal time for electrical upgrades! We coordinate with contractors to run new circuits, add outlets, and upgrade capacity while walls are open, saving you money compared to doing it after the renovation is complete."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between rewiring and an electrical system upgrade?",
      "answer": "Rewiring specifically replaces the wires running through your walls. A full electrical system upgrade may include rewiring plus panel upgrades, new outlets and switches, grounding improvements, and safety device installation—a more comprehensive modernization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer financing for electrical system upgrades?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer flexible financing options for larger projects. We'll discuss all available options during your consultation so you can make the best decision for your budget while not compromising on safety."
