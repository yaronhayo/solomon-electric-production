  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between emergency and standby power?",
      "answer": "Legally, 'emergency' systems power life safety (egress lighting, fire pumps) with strict code requirements: engine start within 10 seconds, separate wiring, specific maintenance. 'Standby' or 'optional standby' powers business operations with fewer code mandates but similar reliability goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you size a generator for our facility?",
      "answer": "We inventory all loads requiring backup, calculate running and starting loads (motors have high inrush), account for load sequencing, and add appropriate safety margin. Proper sizing prevents undersized generators that can't start loads or oversized units wasting fuel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's N+1 redundancy?",
      "answer": "N+1 means having one more generator than minimum required. If your load needs three generators, N+1 provides four—so any one can fail or need maintenance without losing backup capability. Critical facilities like data centers often require N+1."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we need UPS in addition to generators?",
      "answer": "Generators take 10-30 seconds to start and transfer. UPS provides instant, seamless power during this transition. For sensitive electronics and zero-interruption requirements, UPS bridges the gap until generators assume load."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should backup systems run?",
      "answer": "It depends on your needs. Most commercial systems target 24-72 hours fuel capacity. Healthcare has 24-hour minimums. Data centers may require 48-72+ hours. We design fuel capacity based on your operational requirements and refueling logistics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about code requirements for healthcare?",
      "answer": "NFPA 99 and NEC govern healthcare electrical. Requirements include emergency system, life safety system, critical system, and equipment system—each with specific loads and transfer requirements. We design compliant systems for healthcare facilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you upgrade our existing backup system?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We evaluate existing systems, identify limitations, and design upgrades—larger generators, additional transfer capacity, improved redundancy, or better load management. Upgrades often provide significantly better protection than original installations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance do emergency power systems need?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes engine service (oil, filters, coolant), monthly exercising under load, annual load bank testing, transfer switch testing, and fuel system maintenance. We can provide maintenance programs or advise your staff on requirements."
