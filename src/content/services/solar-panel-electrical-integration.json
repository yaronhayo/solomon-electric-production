  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why can't my solar installer handle all the electrical work?",
      "answer": "Some solar installers are fully licensed for electrical work; many are not. Panel upgrades, service changes, and significant electrical modifications often require a licensed electrical contractor. We partner with solar installers to provide the electrical work they need."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the 120% rule for solar connections?",
      "answer": "The NEC limits solar back-feed based on panel bus bar rating. The sum of main breaker and solar breaker can't exceed 120% of bus bar rating. If your 200A panel has 200A bus bars, maximum combined breakers is 240A (200A main + 40A solar). Larger solar systems may need panel upgrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a new electrical panel for solar?",
      "answer": "Not always. If your panel has adequate capacity, space for a solar breaker, and meets the 120% rule, it may work as-is. Many older or full panels need upgrades. We assess your specific situation and recommend only necessary work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about battery backup with solar?",
      "answer": "Battery systems (Tesla Powerwall, Generac PWRcell, etc.) require additional electrical work—battery connections, critical load subpanels, and proper integration with both solar and grid power. We install the electrical infrastructure batteries require."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will solar work during a power outage?",
      "answer": "Standard grid-tied solar without batteries shuts off during outages (anti-islanding safety requirement). Solar with battery backup can power critical loads during outages. We install the battery and electrical infrastructure needed for backup capability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits are required for solar electrical?",
      "answer": "Solar installations require electrical permits for the connection to your panel. If panel upgrades or service changes are involved, those require separate permits. We handle all electrical permitting and inspection coordination."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prepare for solar installation?",
      "answer": "Consider panel capacity and condition. If your panel is old, undersized, or full, address upgrades before or during solar installation. We can assess your panel's solar-readiness and recommend any pre-work that simplifies solar integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's involved in net metering setup?",
      "answer": "Net metering requires utility approval, proper metering equipment, and specific disconnect/connection configurations. Your solar installer handles most utility coordination, but the electrical equipment must be installed correctly. We ensure installation meets FPL requirements."
