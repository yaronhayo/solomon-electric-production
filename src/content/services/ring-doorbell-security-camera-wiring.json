  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you install security cameras I've already purchased?",
      "answer": "Yes. We install cameras from all major brands—Ring, Nest, Arlo, Wyze, Hikvision, Reolink, and others. We can also recommend cameras if you haven't decided yet. Bring your own equipment and we'll handle professional installation and wiring."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does POE camera wiring involve?",
      "answer": "POE (Power over Ethernet) cameras receive power and data through a single network cable. We run Cat5e or Cat6 cable from your router/switch location to each camera position. POE cameras are more reliable than WiFi and don't require separate power wiring."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why isn't my Ring doorbell working properly?",
      "answer": "Most Ring doorbell issues stem from inadequate transformer power. Older doorbell transformers often provide only 10-16 volts, while Ring doorbells need 16-24 volts with adequate VA rating. We install upgraded transformers that provide proper power for reliable operation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you hide camera wires inside walls?",
      "answer": "Yes—this is our standard approach. We route wiring through attics, walls, and soffits to hide cables. Low-voltage camera wiring doesn't require the same separation rules as electrical wiring, giving us flexibility in routing. The result is a clean, professional installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need an NVR or is cloud storage enough?",
      "answer": "It depends on your needs. Cloud storage is convenient but requires internet and usually involves subscription fees. Local NVR (Network Video Recorder) provides backup recording and typically higher quality than cloud, without monthly costs. Many systems use both for redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many cameras do I need?",
      "answer": "Coverage depends on your property layout. At minimum, cover all entry doors (front, back, garage). Larger properties benefit from cameras covering driveways, side yard access, and backyard areas. We'll assess your property and recommend optimal camera quantity and placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about outdoor cameras and Florida weather?",
      "answer": "All outdoor cameras we install are rated for weather exposure. We ensure proper mounting that sheds water, seal cable entry points, and position cameras where rain and sun exposure won't affect performance. Florida conditions require attention to these details."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can cameras integrate with my smart home system?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most modern cameras integrate with Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and smart home platforms. We configure integrations during installation so you can view cameras on smart displays, receive alerts, and include cameras in automation routines."
