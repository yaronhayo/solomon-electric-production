  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you run HDMI cables through walls?",
      "answer": "Yes, with appropriate cables. Regular HDMI cables aren't rated for in-wall use—we use in-wall rated HDMI cables or conduit to meet code. For long runs, active HDMI cables or fiber HDMI maintain signal quality. We select appropriate cables for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you hide TV power cords?",
      "answer": "We install a recessed outlet box behind the TV and an inlet plate at the bottom of the wall near your equipment. Power runs inside the wall from outlet to inlet. This is the code-compliant way to eliminate visible power cords—not just cable covers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about wireless speakers—do I still need wiring?",
      "answer": "Wireless speakers still need power, and many 'wireless' systems use wired rear speakers. Even fully wireless systems benefit from strategic outlets. However, wireless technology has advanced significantly—we can discuss whether wired installation makes sense for your setup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install for Sonos, Bose, and other systems?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We work with all audio/video systems. Whether you're doing Sonos whole-home audio, traditional receiver-based systems, or soundbars with wireless subwoofers, we provide the wiring infrastructure these systems need."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it too late to add wiring after construction?",
      "answer": "No—retrofit wiring is more challenging but usually possible. We route through attics, crawl spaces, and strategic wall cuts to achieve hidden installation. It costs more than pre-wire but the results are nearly identical."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cable do you recommend for 4K/8K video?",
      "answer": "For HDMI 2.1 (8K/120Hz), we use certified Ultra High Speed HDMI cables. For long runs, fiber HDMI provides reliable high-resolution signal over distances that copper can't achieve. We match cable selection to your specific equipment and run lengths."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you wire for outdoor speakers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Outdoor speaker wire runs need weather protection at entry points and appropriate routing. We can wire for covered patio speakers, poolside audio, and outdoor entertainment areas throughout your property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install the actual equipment?",
      "answer": "Our focus is the wiring infrastructure—cables, outlets, and proper terminations. Some clients prefer to handle their own equipment installation; others want complete installation help. We can discuss how much installation support you need."
