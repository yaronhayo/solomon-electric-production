  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How is your inspection different from the general home inspection?",
      "answer": "General home inspectors spend 5-10 minutes on electrical and check basic function. We perform comprehensive assessment by a licensed electrician—examining connections, testing outlets, identifying code issues, and providing specific repair recommendations and costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you inspect?",
      "answer": "We offer flexible scheduling for urgent transactions. Standard scheduling is usually within a few business days. For large or complex properties, additional lead time helps us allocate appropriate resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "How soon do we get the report?",
      "answer": "Reports are provided following the inspection. For urgent transactions, we can prioritize report delivery. Let us know your deadline and we'll work to meet it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide repair estimates?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our reports include estimated repair costs for identified issues. This information supports negotiation and helps buyers/investors budget for post-closing work. Estimates are opinion based on typical costs—not binding quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect multi-family or commercial properties?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We regularly inspect apartment buildings, small multi-family, and commercial properties. Larger properties may require multiple inspectors or additional time—we provide appropriate resources and accurate quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do agents schedule directly with you?",
      "answer": "Yes. Agents can schedule inspections directly on behalf of their clients. We work with many local agents and understand transaction timing needs. We're easy to work with and responsive to agent communications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if major issues are found?",
      "answer": "We document findings objectively and provide repair recommendations. How parties proceed is their decision—negotiated repairs, seller credits, price adjustments, or walking away. We also provide repair services if needed after closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you do the repairs after inspection?",
      "answer": "Yes. Many buyers return to us after closing to complete recommended repairs. We already understand the property and can prioritize work appropriately. This is one advantage of using a licensed contractor for inspection—they can also perform repairs."
