  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Smart bulbs vs. smart switches—which is better?",
      "answer": "Smart switches replace your wall switches and work with any bulb—family members can still use physical switches normally. Smart bulbs offer color changing but require the switch to stay on. We often recommend smart switches for convenience and smart bulbs where color is desired."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do smart lights work without WiFi?",
      "answer": "Smart bulbs and WiFi switches require internet for remote control and voice commands. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices work locally through their hubs even without internet. Most smart lights still function as regular lights if WiFi fails—you just lose smart features."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will smart lighting work with my existing fixtures?",
      "answer": "Yes. Smart bulbs screw into existing sockets. Smart switches replace wall switches and work with any fixture. Neither requires changing your actual light fixtures. The only consideration is ensuring smart dimmers are compatible with your bulb types."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which smart home system should I use?",
      "answer": "It depends on your ecosystem. Alexa integrates with the widest variety of devices. Google Home works well for Android users. Apple HomeKit offers the best privacy. For maximum flexibility, Zigbee or Z-Wave devices with SmartThings work across platforms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I install color-changing lights?",
      "answer": "Yes! Color-changing smart bulbs (RGB) let you set any color. Use colors for ambiance, holidays, parties, or even to indicate events (like flashing when someone's at the door). Color-changing adds fun and function to smart lighting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't have a neutral wire?",
      "answer": "Many smart switches require neutral wires that older homes lack. Options include: Lutron Caseta (no neutral required), certain Inovelli switches, smart bulbs (no switch modification needed), or having us run neutral wires. We assess and recommend the best approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can smart lighting be controlled when I'm away?",
      "answer": "Yes, from anywhere with internet. Check if you left lights on from work. Turn lights on before arriving home. Create vacation schedules from the beach. Remote control is one of smart lighting's best features."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is smart lighting reliable?",
      "answer": "Quality smart lighting products are very reliable. Issues typically relate to WiFi connectivity rather than the devices themselves. We ensure strong WiFi coverage and recommend proven products. Physical switches always work even if smart features temporarily fail."
