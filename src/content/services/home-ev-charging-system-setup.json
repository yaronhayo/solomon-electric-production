    {
      "question": "I just ordered an EV—where do I start?",
      "answer": "Contact us for a consultation. We'll discuss your EV model, where you park, your panel situation, and your preferences. We'll recommend the right charging approach and can have it installed before your EV arrives."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 charging?",
      "answer": "Level 1 uses a standard 120V outlet—about 4 miles of range per hour (40 miles overnight). Level 2 uses 240V—about 25-30 miles per hour (full charge overnight for most EVs). Most homeowners want Level 2 for practical daily charging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a specific charger for my EV brand?",
      "answer": "Most EVs use the standard J1772 connector that works with any Level 2 EVSE. Teslas come with an adapter or can use Universal Wall Connectors. We recommend equipment compatible with your specific vehicle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get a smart charger?",
      "answer": "Smart chargers offer valuable features: scheduled charging for off-peak rates, energy monitoring, remote control, and integration with utility programs. If you'll use these features, smart chargers pay for themselves in energy savings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have two EVs or might add another?",
      "answer": "We can plan for multiple EVs—either separate circuits for each parking spot or a shared circuit with power-sharing capability. Planning during initial installation is much more cost-effective than adding later."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I save money on EV charging?",
      "answer": "FPL offers time-of-use rates where overnight electricity costs less. Smart chargers can schedule charging during these hours automatically. We set up scheduling during installation so savings start immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my panel is full or too small?",
      "answer": "Options include: panel upgrade for more capacity, tandem breakers for more circuits, load management devices that share capacity, or charging at lower power levels. We evaluate your situation and recommend the best approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does complete setup take?",
      "answer": "Simple installations often complete in one visit. If panel work is needed, it may be two visits. Panel upgrades add time. We provide realistic timelines when we assess your situation."
