    {
      "question": "How should one begin planning for home charging?",
      "answer": "A technical consultation identifies the specific infrastructure requirements based on the vehicle model, property layout, and existing electrical capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between Level 1 and Level 2?",
      "answer": "Level 1 utilizes standard 120V residential circuits, while Level 2 requires a dedicated 240V circuit capable of delivering significantly more energy for faster replenishment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is brand-specific hardware required?",
      "answer": "Most vehicles utilize standardized connectors like the J1772 or NACS. Charging hardware is selected based on compatibility with the vehicle's intake and the property's electrical system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of a smart-enabled charger?",
      "answer": "Smart chargers include features for monitoring energy usage, remote control capability, and integration with utility demand-management programs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are multiple electric vehicles accommodated?",
      "answer": "Multi-vehicle configurations may involve separate circuits or load-sharing equipment that balances the available electrical capacity between multiple units."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the standard procedure for a full installation?",
      "answer": "The installation timeframe is dependent on the complexity of the wire run and any requirements for electrical panel modifications or utility coordination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my existing electrical panel support an EV charger?",
      "answer": "Most 200-amp panels can accommodate a 240V EV charging circuit. If your panel is 100 amps or nearly full, we may recommend a panel upgrade or a load management device to safely add the charger without overloading your system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 home charging?",
      "answer": "Level 1 uses a standard 120V outlet and adds about 4-5 miles of range per hour. Level 2 uses a dedicated 240V circuit and adds 25-30 miles per hour—making it the preferred solution for daily commuters and most EV owners."
