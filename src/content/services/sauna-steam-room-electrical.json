  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What electrical does a sauna heater need?",
      "answer": "Most residential sauna heaters require 240V, 30-50 amp circuits. Larger commercial saunas may need multiple heaters or higher amperage. Exact requirements are on heater specifications—we match wiring to manufacturer requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my existing panel handle a sauna?",
      "answer": "It depends on current panel capacity and existing loads. Many panels can accommodate sauna circuits. Older or heavily loaded panels may need upgrade. We assess capacity before providing installation quote."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about lighting in the sauna?",
      "answer": "Sauna lighting requires high-temperature rated fixtures specifically designed for sauna use. Standard fixtures fail quickly in sauna heat. We install fixtures rated for the extreme temperatures inside saunas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does steam room electrical differ from sauna?",
      "answer": "Steam generators are outside the steam room (away from moisture), so electrical exposure is less extreme. However, any electrical inside the steam room needs wet-location rating. Overall, steam room electrical is somewhat less demanding than sauna."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the sauna disconnect go?",
      "answer": "Code requires visible disconnect within sight of the heater. This is typically mounted outside the sauna room but visible through a window or adjacent to the door. We install disconnects meeting code requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What wire rating is needed for saunas?",
      "answer": "Wiring inside sauna enclosures must be rated for high temperature. Standard NM ('Romex') cables can't handle sauna heat. We use THHN in conduit or other appropriately rated wiring methods inside heated areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I convert an existing room to a sauna?",
      "answer": "Yes, with appropriate modifications. Electrical needs include dedicated heater circuit, proper disconnect, temperature-rated interior wiring, and sauna-rated lighting. We can handle the electrical portion of sauna conversion projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do infrared saunas have different requirements?",
      "answer": "Infrared saunas operate at lower temperatures and often lower power than traditional saunas. Many plug into standard 120V outlets or need simple 240V circuits. Requirements vary by unit—we match installation to your specific infrared sauna specs."
