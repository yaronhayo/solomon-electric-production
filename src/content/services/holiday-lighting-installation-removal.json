  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "When should I book holiday lighting installation?",
      "answer": "Book early—October or early November. Popular installation dates fill quickly. Early booking ensures installation before Thanksgiving and allows time for any custom lights to arrive. Last-minute requests may not be accommodable during peak season."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide the lights or do I?",
      "answer": "Either works. We can provide commercial-grade LED lights sized for your property, or we can install lights you already own. Our lights provide specific visual and durability benefits. Using existing lights is an option if they are in good condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you attach lights without damaging my home?",
      "answer": "We use clips designed for each application—shingle clips, gutter clips, tree clips—that attach without nails or screws. When we remove lights, no damage remains. The same clips work year after year."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about lights for my palm trees?",
      "answer": "Florida palm trees look spectacular wrapped with lights! We spiral-wrap trunks and can add lights to fronds for dramatic effects. LED lights are cool-running and safe for trees. Palm lighting is one of our most popular requests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you repair or troubleshoot existing displays?",
      "answer": "Yes. If your existing lights have problems—burned sections, flickering, timer issues—we can troubleshoot and repair. Sometimes repair is more cost-effective than replacement; other times new lights make more sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if lights stop working during the season?",
      "answer": "Lights we provide include service during the season. If sections fail, we return to repair or replace. This is one advantage of professional service over DIY—you have support if problems occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you install for businesses too?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Commercial holiday displays are a significant part of our business. Retail stores, office buildings, restaurants, and shopping centers all benefit from professional holiday lighting that impresses customers and creates festive atmosphere."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does removal service include?",
      "answer": "We return after holidays (typically January) to carefully remove all lights and accessories, inspect for any damage, pack everything properly, label for next year, and either store on-site in your specified location or hold at our facility. Everything is ready for next season."
