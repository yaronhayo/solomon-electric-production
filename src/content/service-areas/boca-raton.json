    {
      "question": "Do you have experience with large estate electrical systems in Royal Palm or Boca West?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We regularly work in Royal Palm Yacht & Country Club, Boca West, St. Andrews, and Woodfield—homes that often have 400-amp or even 600-amp service, multiple sub-panels, sophisticated lighting control systems, and whole-home automation. These properties require electricians who understand high-capacity distribution, can coordinate with architects and builders, and appreciate the level of quality expected in Boca's premier communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's different about electrical permitting in Boca Raton versus Broward County?",
      "answer": "Boca Raton falls under Palm Beach County jurisdiction, which has different permit processes and inspection schedules than Miami-Dade or Broward. We pull permits through Palm Beach County for all Boca Raton work and are familiar with their specific requirements. The process is slightly different—and the fees are higher—but we handle everything so you don't need to navigate the bureaucracy yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate high-end lighting control systems like Lutron or Control4?",
      "answer": "Yes—we're experienced with premium automation platforms including Lutron RadioRA, Homeworks, Control4, and Savant. Many Boca Raton estates use these systems for whole-home lighting control, motorized shades, and scene programming. We can install new systems, expand existing ones, add keypads, and troubleshoot integration issues. We also work collaboratively with your home automation integrator when complex coordination is needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Boca Raton home has a backup generator, but it hasn't been used in years—can you inspect it?",
      "answer": "Yes, generator maintenance and inspection is one of our services. Many Boca Raton homes have Generac, Kohler, or Cummins standby generators that have sat dormant for years. We inspect the electrical connections, transfer switch operation, and recommend the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. A generator that doesn't work when the power goes out is worse than no generator at all—you're unprepared without realizing it."
    },
    {
      "question": "We're building a new home in The Oaks—do you work on new construction?",
      "answer": "Yes, we work on both new construction and renovations. For new builds in Boca Raton, we coordinate with your general contractor to install the complete electrical system—from temporary power through final trim. We're experienced with the inspection sequences, know Palm Beach County's specific requirements, and design wire runs that accommodate future technology upgrades. If your builder doesn't have a preferred electrician, we'd be glad to provide a competitive bid."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to electrical emergencies in east Boca Raton?",
      "answer": "We maintain coverage in Palm Beach County to serve Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach. For situation-specific emergencies—such as sparking or complete power loss—we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
