            "answer": "Absolutely. Century Village is one of our most-served communities. We understand the condo association coordination required, the fixed-income budget considerations, and the specific electrical challenges of these buildings. We're patient, explain everything clearly, and provide honest service standards with no surprises. Many Century Village residents call us specifically because their neighbors recommend us."

        {
            "question": "Why do outdoor electrical fixtures fail faster on Deerfield Beach oceanfront properties?",
            "answer": "Properties east of A1A face constant salt spray that aggressively corrodes standard electrical hardware. We see outdoor outlets, light fixtures, and panel enclosures fail in 3-5 years that would last 15+ years inland. For Deerfield Beach oceanfront, we exclusively use marine-grade stainless hardware and sealed enclosures designed for the harshest coastal conditions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you install electrical for our Hillsboro Mile estate?",
            "answer": "Yes, we work on Hillsboro Mile's exclusive waterfront estates. These properties often require complex electrical systems: multiple panels, landscape lighting spanning large properties, dock and seawall power, pool equipment circuits, and sophisticated automation. We understand the quality expectations and work with architects and builders to deliver systems that match the caliber of these homes."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you handle commercial electrical near The Cove and Hillsboro Boulevard?",
            "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services throughout Deerfield Beach's business districts including The Cove, Hillsboro Boulevard, and the industrial areas. Services include tenant buildouts, retail lighting, restaurant electrical, and 24/7 emergency response for businesses that can't afford extended outages."

        {
            "question": "Our 1970s Deerfield home has a fuse box—is that a problem?",
            "answer": "Fuse boxes were phased out decades ago for good reason. They're less safe than modern breaker panels, offer no GFCI or AFCI protection, and can't handle the electrical loads of modern homes. More practically, insurance companies often require panel upgrades before issuing policies on homes with fuse boxes. Upgrading to a modern 200-amp panel is one of the best investments you can make in your Deerfield home."
