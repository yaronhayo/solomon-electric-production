    {
      "question": "Do you understand the electrical requirements for world-class equestrian barns?",
      "answer": "Yes, Wellington's equestrian facilities are part of our specialty work. Horse barns require dust-tight fixtures to handle hay and bedding, GFCI protection throughout, safe switch and outlet placement away from horse contact, and properly rated circuits for fans, heaters, and wash stall equipment. Arena lighting is another specialty—we design and install arena systems that meet competition standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Wellington estate needs more than 200 amps—can you handle that?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many Wellington estates require 400-600 amp service to power main homes, guest houses, pools, outdoor entertainment, barns, and extensive landscape lighting. We design multi-panel systems with proper load balancing, coordinate with FPL for service upgrades, and ensure your estate has the capacity for current needs plus future additions."
    },
    {
      "question": "During polo season, our property hosts events—can you handle temporary electrical?",
      "answer": "Yes, we understand the seasonal surge in electrical demand during Wellington's equestrian and polo season. We can install temporary power for tents and hospitality areas, ensure existing systems are ready for heavy use, and provide on-call support during events. Planning ahead is key—book early for polo season electrical needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you integrate with high-end home automation systems like Savant or Control4?",
      "answer": "Yes, we're experienced with luxury automation platforms including Savant, Control4, Crestron, and Lutron. For Wellington estates, we provide the electrical infrastructure that automation systems require—proper panel capacity, dedicated control circuits, low-voltage wiring runs, and coordination with automation integrators."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wellington has intense summer lightning—how do we protect our systems?",
      "answer": "Western Palm Beach County is extremely lightning-prone. For Wellington properties with significant electronics, automation, and expensive equestrian equipment, we recommend comprehensive surge protection: whole-home protection at the main panel, plus point-of-use protection for sensitive systems. This multi-layer approach catches surges before they damage expensive equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Wellington?",
      "answer": "We provide emergency electrical service to Wellington and the western Palm Beach County communities. Our licensed electricians handle critical situations including total power loss, electrical burning smells, and panel failures. Contact us 24/7 for immediate assistance—our team is available around the clock."
