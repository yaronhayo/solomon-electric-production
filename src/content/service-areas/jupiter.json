  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "We have 5 acres in Jupiter Farms—can you handle the whole property?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Jupiter Farms properties often have multiple structures requiring coordinated electrical: main homes, guest houses, workshops, horse barns, and extensive landscape lighting. We design systems with proper sub-panels for each structure, underground runs between buildings, and generators sized to handle the full load when needed. Properties on well water need special consideration for pump backup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work in Admiral's Cove and other waterfront communities?",
      "answer": "Yes, Jupiter's premier waterfront estates are a significant part of our luxury residential work. Admiral's Cove, The Bluffs, and Loxahatchee River properties require high-capacity electrical systems (often 400+ amps), marine-grade outdoor components, dock and seawall power, and integration with sophisticated automation systems. We understand the quality expectations in these communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's involved in installing dock power on the Loxahatchee River?",
      "answer": "Loxahatchee waterfront properties need dock electrical that meets NEC Article 555 marina safety requirements. We install properly rated dock pedestals, shore power connections, boat lift circuits, underwater lighting, and all with GFCI protection and corrosion-resistant components. Salt exposure is less intense than oceanfront, but proper materials still matter for longevity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you serve businesses in Abacoa Town Center?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services in Abacoa and throughout Jupiter's business areas. Services include tenant buildouts, restaurant electrical, retail lighting, and 24/7 emergency response. We understand that Jupiter businesses have high standards and can't afford extended electrical downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jupiter Farms has frequent power outages—should we install a generator?",
      "answer": "Generator installation is very common for Jupiter Farms properties. The area's rural nature and extensive tree cover mean outages happen more frequently and last longer than in urban areas. For properties on well water, generators are nearly essential—when power goes out, so does your water. We size generators to handle well pumps, AC, and essential circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Jupiter?",
      "answer": "We provide electrical services to the Jupiter area as part of our northern Palm Beach County coverage. For urgent requirements, we allocate technical resources based on the specific safety needs of the property."
