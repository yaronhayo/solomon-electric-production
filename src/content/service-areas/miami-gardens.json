    {
      "question": "My Carol City home was built in the 1970s and has aluminum wiring—is that dangerous?",
      "answer": "Aluminum wiring requires attention. When aluminum meets copper—at outlets, switches, and panel connections—the different expansion rates create loose connections that can arc and overheat. We don't necessarily recommend a full rewire, but aluminum wiring does need proper remediation: special AL/CU connectors, COPALUM crimps, or in some cases, targeted copper pigtailing. We'll inspect your home and recommend the most cost-effective solution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with the commercial properties near Hard Rock Stadium?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Hard Rock Stadium area brings unique electrical needs—businesses preparing for event surges, temporary power for vendors, parking lot lighting upgrades, and commercial tenant buildouts. We handle everything from small retail electrical to large-scale commercial projects. We're experienced with the event-day power demands and can help businesses prepare for game days and concerts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Miami Gardens home keeps tripping the main breaker when the AC runs—why?",
      "answer": "This is extremely common in Miami Gardens homes with original 100-amp or 150-amp panels. Modern 3-4 ton AC units draw significant power, and combined with a pool pump, appliances, and electronics, these older panels simply can't keep up. The solution is typically a panel upgrade to 200 amps, which provides headroom for current and future electrical demands. This is one of our most common Miami Gardens projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my Federal Pacific panel really a fire hazard?",
      "answer": "Yes—Federal Pacific Stab-Lok panels have a well-documented history of breakers failing to trip during overloads. This means wires can overheat without protection, creating fire risk. If your Miami Gardens home has an FPE panel (common in 1970s-80s construction), we strongly recommend replacement. Many insurance companies now require it. We can inspect your panel and provide an honest assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add more outlets in an older Miami Gardens home?",
      "answer": "Yes, and it's one of our common projects. 1960s-80s homes were built with far fewer outlets than modern electrical codes require or families need today. Adding outlets is relatively straightforward and much safer than relying on extension cords and power strips. We can add outlets to any room and include dedicated circuits for high-draw items like space heaters or window AC units."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Miami Gardens?",
      "answer": "Miami Gardens is well within our primary service area, with excellent access via I-95, the Palmetto Expressway, and 27th Avenue.  For after-hours emergencies involving sparking, burning smells, or complete outages, we allocate resources."

      "body": "Miami Gardens presents unique electrical challenges that require local knowledge. Many homes in neighborhoods like Carol City and Andover were built between the 1960s and 1980s—an era of 100-amp panels and aluminum wiring that can't safely support today's HVAC systems, home offices, and modern appliances. Add South Florida's notorious hurricane season and the constant demand of year-round air conditioning, and you have a recipe for electrical stress. Our electricians understand these challenges because we've spent years solving them for your neighbors."
