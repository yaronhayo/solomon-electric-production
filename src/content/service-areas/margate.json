    {
      "question": "Our Margate home was built in the 1960s\u2014what should we be concerned about?",
      "answer": "Margate's 1960s homes often have original 100-amp panels (or even fuse boxes), outdated wiring that wasn't designed for modern AC loads, and minimal outlet coverage. Common issues include overloaded circuits, deteriorating insulation in attic wiring, and a lack of GFCI protection near water. We provide honest inspections that identify the most pressing issues\u2014we won't oversell, but we'll tell you what matters."

      "question": "We live in Holiday Springs\u2014do you understand senior community needs?",

    {
      "question": "Do you work on manufactured or mobile homes in Margate?",
      "answer": "Yes, we service manufactured homes and understand their specific electrical requirements\u2014smaller panel configurations, aluminum wiring considerations, and space constraints. Whether you need a panel upgrade, outlet additions, or generator installation, we can help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is surge protection worth the cost for a Margate home?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially given Broward's frequent summer lightning. A whole-home surge protector installed at your panel catches voltage spikes before they reach your electronics, appliances, and HVAC. The protection costs a fraction of replacing damaged equipment. For older Margate homes with sensitive electronics and aging wiring, it's extra peace of mind during storm season."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install pool equipment electrical in Margate?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Pool pump circuits, heater connections, landscape lighting around the pool area, and proper GFCI protection are all essential for safe pool operation. Many Margate pools were installed decades ago and may not meet current safety codes. We can inspect your pool electrical and upgrade where needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Margate?",
      "answer": "Margate is well within our central Broward service area.  For after-hours emergencies involving sparking, burning smells, or complete power loss, we allocate resources."
