    {
      "question": "We have horses—do you understand the electrical requirements for barns and stables?",
      "answer": "Yes, equestrian electrical is one of our specialties in Davie. Horse barns have specific requirements: dust-tight fixtures to handle hay and shavings, GFCI protection throughout, properly rated circuits for fans and heaters, and safe placement of outlets and switches where horses can't reach them. We also install arena lighting, wash stall power, and electric fence controllers—all common needs in Davie's equestrian community."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Long Lake Ranches property has multiple structures—can you handle the whole compound?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Large acreage properties in Davie—Long Lake Ranches, Rolling Hills, and Ivanhoe—often have main homes, guest houses, pool houses, barns, and workshops that all need coordinated electrical service. We design systems with proper sub-panels, underground runs between structures, and load balancing to ensure reliable power across your entire property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work near Nova Southeastern University?",
      "answer": "Yes, we serve the entire University Drive corridor in Davie, including commercial properties near NSU and the educational campus complex. Services include tenant buildouts, classroom lighting upgrades, lab electrical requirements, and 24/7 emergency support for businesses serving the university community."
    },
    {
      "question": "Davie gets hit hard by afternoon thunderstorms—should I get surge protection?",
      "answer": "Definitely. Western Broward is among the most lightning-prone areas in the country, and Davie's proximity to the Everglades means intense summer storms. Whole-home surge protection at your panel is essential—it catches voltage spikes from nearby strikes before they damage your electronics, appliances, and HVAC equipment. We recommend this for every Davie home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install a generator for our Davie property with well water?",
      "answer": "Yes—and for properties on well water, generator installation is even more critical. When power goes out, you lose not just AC but also your water supply. We size generators to handle well pumps, AC systems, and essential circuits simultaneously. Many Davie homeowners with wells consider generators essential, not optional."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies near Griffin Road or Orange Drive?",
      "answer": "We maintain coverage in Davie to assist with residential and commercial electrical requirements. For situation-specific emergencies—such as sparking or burning smells—we prioritize the allocation of technical resources across the service area."
