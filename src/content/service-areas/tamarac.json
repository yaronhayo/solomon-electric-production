    {
      "question": "We live in Kings Point Tamarac—do you regularly work in our community?",
      "answer": "Yes, Kings Point Tamarac is one of our most-served communities. We understand the specific requirements: coordinating with building management, respecting community rules, and working within the typical schedules of 55+ residents. Many Kings Point residents have recommended us to their neighbors—we take that trust seriously and treat every home with care and respect."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Tamarac home was built in the 1970s—what electrical problems are common?",
      "answer": "Tamarac's 1970s-80s housing often has 100-amp or 150-amp panels that are now 40-50 years old. Common issues include Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels (known fire hazards), aluminum wiring connections that need remediation, GFCI outlets that have never been updated, and capacity that's insufficient for modern AC systems and appliances. We provide thorough inspections and honest recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer evening or weekend appointments for Tamarac residents who still work?",
      "answer": "Yes, we understand that not everyone is available during traditional business hours. We offer flexible scheduling for Tamarac residents, including early morning, evening, and weekend appointments when needed. We also work efficiently to minimize disruption—most panel upgrades are completed in a single day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Mainlands townhouse has very few outlets—can you add more?",
      "answer": "Definitely. Older Tamarac construction typically has far fewer outlets than modern homes. Adding outlets is relatively straightforward and much safer than relying on extension cords and power strips, which are fire hazards. We can add outlets throughout your home, including dedicated circuits for high-draw items like space heaters or window units."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is whole-home surge protection worth it for a Tamarac home?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially in Tamarac. Your area experiences frequent summer lightning, and power fluctuations are common. A whole-home surge protector at your panel catches voltage spikes before they reach your electronics, appliances, and HVAC. For the relatively modest cost, it protects significant value in equipment and gives you peace of mind during storm season."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to electrical emergencies in Tamarac?",
      "answer": "Tamarac is centrally located in our Broward service area with excellent access via the Sawgrass Expressway, Turnpike, and Commercial Boulevard.  For after-hours emergencies, we allocate resources for safety hazards."
