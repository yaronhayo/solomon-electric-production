    {
      "question": "My Sunrise home was built in the 1970s and has a Federal Pacific panel—should I be worried?",
      "answer": "Yes—Federal Pacific panels are a documented fire hazard. Breakers in these panels often fail to trip during overloads, allowing wires to overheat and potentially start fires. If your Sunrise home has a Federal Pacific (FPE) panel, we strongly recommend replacement. These panels were commonly installed in 1970s-80s Sunrise homes, and insurance companies are increasingly requiring their replacement before issuing policies."
    },
    {
      "question": "We live in a Sunrise senior community—do you work in places like Sunrise Lakes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We serve many residents in Sunrise Lakes, Kings Point, and other 55+ communities. We understand the unique considerations: communicating clearly about work and costs, respecting your schedule and routines, and coordinating with building management when needed. We're patient, thorough, and happy to explain everything in detail."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide commercial electrical near Sawgrass Mills or the Arena?",
      "answer": "Yes, we service the entire Sawgrass commercial district including retailers near Sawgrass Mills, businesses around Amerant Bank Arena, and the corporate offices along Sawgrass Expressway. Services include tenant buildouts, parking lot lighting, emergency repairs, and scheduled maintenance. We understand that retail and entertainment venues can't afford extended electrical downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are my lights flickering in my 1980s Sunrise home?",
      "answer": "Flickering lights in older Sunrise homes typically indicate one of several issues: loose connections at the panel, corroded breakers, overloaded circuits, or problems with the FPL connection. All of these are more common in 40-year-old electrical systems. We can diagnose the specific cause and recommend either targeted repairs or a more comprehensive upgrade depending on what we find."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add outlets in my Sunrise home? We never have enough.",
      "answer": "Definitely—insufficient outlets are a hallmark of 1970s-80s construction. Homes built then typically have far fewer outlets than modern codes require or families need. We can add outlets to any room, including dedicated circuits for high-draw items like space heaters or window AC units. Adding outlets is relatively straightforward and much safer than relying on extension cords and power strips."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you get to Sunrise for an emergency?",
      "answer": "Sunrise is central to our Broward service area with direct access via I-595, the Sawgrass Expressway, and I-75.  For after-hours emergencies—sparking panels, burning smells, or complete outages—we allocate resources."
