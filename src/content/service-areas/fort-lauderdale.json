    {
      "question": "Do you install electrical for boat lifts and dock pedestals in Fort Lauderdale?",
      "answer": "Yes—waterfront electrical is one of our specialties in the Venice of America. We install and repair dock pedestals, boat lift motors, shore power connections, and marine-grade lighting throughout Las Olas Isles, Rio Vista, and Harbor Beach. All waterfront electrical must meet strict NEC Article 555 requirements for marina safety. We ensure your dock electrical is safe, code-compliant, and properly protected from corrosion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Fort Lauderdale electrical work different from inland areas?",
      "answer": "Fort Lauderdale's extensive canal system means many properties deal with higher humidity, salt exposure, and flooding risks that inland homes don't face. We use corrosion-resistant hardware, marine-grade connections, and elevated installation techniques for outdoor electrical. Properties on the Intracoastal or in flood zones require special attention to weatherhead height, panel placement, and GFCI protection zones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you upgrade the electrical in my Victoria Park or Sailboat Bend home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. These historic Fort Lauderdale neighborhoods have beautiful older homes that often need careful electrical modernization. We've upgraded dozens of 1920s-1950s homes in Victoria Park and Sailboat Bend—replacing outdated panels, installing proper grounding, and adding capacity for modern living while preserving the character that makes these neighborhoods special. Many of these homes still have original 60-amp service that desperately needs upgrading."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for electrical work in Fort Lauderdale?",
      "answer": "All significant electrical work in Fort Lauderdale requires Broward County permits. This includes panel upgrades, new circuits, EV chargers, and outlet additions. We handle all permitting with Broward County—you don't need to visit the building department or coordinate inspections. Our 100% inspection pass rate means your project won't face delays or re-work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide electrical services for vacation rentals on Fort Lauderdale Beach?",
      "answer": "Yes, we work with many vacation rental owners on Galt Ocean Mile and Fort Lauderdale Beach. Common needs include adding outlets for guest convenience, installing smart locks and thermostats, upgrading lighting for better photos, and ensuring all GFCIs work properly (a common guest complaint). Quick turnaround between tenants is essential—we schedule around your booking calendar."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can you respond to emergencies near Las Olas or Downtown Fort Lauderdale?",
      "answer": "We maintain coverage across Broward County to assist with electrical requirements in central Fort Lauderdale. For situation-specific emergencies—such as sparking or burning smells—we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
