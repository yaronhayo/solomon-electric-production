      "question": "Our Hialeah house was built in the 1950s and still has the original panel\u2014is that dangerous?",
      "answer": "Potentially yes. Many Hialeah homes from the 1950s-60s have original 60-amp or 100-amp panels with fuses instead of breakers, and outdated wiring that can't safely handle modern loads. Common issues include Federal Pacific or Zinsco breakers (known fire hazards), cloth-insulated wiring (deteriorates over decades), and insufficient capacity for AC and modern appliances. We offer free safety inspections to assess your specific situation and provide honest recommendations."

    {
      "question": "Do you provide electrical services for Hialeah's warehouses and industrial buildings?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014Hialeah's industrial district is a significant part of our commercial work. We handle 3-phase power installations, machine equipment wiring, high-bay LED lighting retrofits, sub-panel installations for new equipment, and emergency repairs that keep your operations running. We understand that warehouse downtime costs money, so we respond quickly and work efficiently to minimize disruption to your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Hialeah home keeps tripping the breaker when we use the window AC and microwave together\u2014why?",
      "answer": "This is the classic sign of an overloaded circuit, extremely common in older Hialeah homes. Houses built 40-60 years ago weren't designed for today's electrical demands. The solution is typically a panel upgrade to 200 amps combined with adding dedicated circuits for high-draw appliances. We provide honest assessments\u2014if a simple circuit addition solves your problem, we won't push you toward a full panel upgrade you don't need."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a panel upgrade cost in Hialeah?",
      "answer": "Panel upgrade costs depend on your specific situation\u2014the current panel condition, service entrance requirements, FPL coordination needs, and your home's wiring. For Hialeah homes, typical 200-amp panel upgrades range from professional standard that reflects honest work. We provide detailed written estimates before any work begins, with no hidden fees. We respect that Hialeah is a working community and price our services fairly."
