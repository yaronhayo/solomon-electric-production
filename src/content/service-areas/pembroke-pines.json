    {
      "question": "We just bought a house in Pembroke Falls\u2014the original owner never upgraded anything. Where do we start?",
      "answer": "Many Pembroke Falls, Chapel Trail, and Pembroke Isles homes were built in the 1990s-2000s with 150-amp or 200-amp panels that are now 20-30 years old. We recommend starting with a full electrical safety inspection to identify immediate concerns, then prioritizing upgrades based on your needs. Common first projects include panel inspection, adding GFCI outlets where missing, and assessing capacity for EV chargers or pool equipment you may want to add."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need HOA approval for electrical work in my Pembroke Pines community?",
      "answer": "Most interior electrical work doesn't require HOA approval, but anything visible from outside\u2014outdoor lighting, EV charger installations, generator placement\u2014often does. We're familiar with the HOA requirements in Silver Lakes, Pembroke Isles, Chapel Trail, and other Pines communities. We'll advise you on what needs approval and can provide documentation your HOA may request as part of their review process."
    },
    {
      "question": "My parents live in Century Village\u2014do you work with senior residents?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We serve many residents in Century Village and understand the unique considerations: fixed incomes requiring transparent service standards, accessibility considerations during work, and the specific electrical challenges of these multi-unit communities. We're patient, thorough, and happy to explain everything clearly. We also coordinate with building management when required for Century Village electrical work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add an EV charger to my Pembroke Pines home without upgrading the panel?",
      "answer": "It depends on your current panel capacity and existing loads. Many Pembroke Pines homes built after 2000 have 200-amp service that can accommodate an EV charger without upgrades. Older homes or those with pools, hot tubs, or multiple AC units may need a load calculation to determine if you have room. We assess this during our free site evaluation and give you honest options\u2014we won't sell you a panel upgrade unless you truly need it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do summer thunderstorms affect my Pembroke Pines home's electronics?",
      "answer": "Western Broward gets more lightning strikes than almost anywhere in the country. Each strike on nearby power infrastructure sends voltage spikes through FPL lines into your home. These surges damage sensitive electronics over time\u2014computers, smart TVs, gaming systems, smart home devices. Whole-home surge protection at your panel catches these spikes before they reach your devices. It's one of the most valuable upgrades for any Pembroke Pines home."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in western Pembroke Pines?",
      "answer": "We maintain coverage throughout Broward County to assist with electrical requirements in Pembroke Pines. For situation-specific emergencies\u2014such as sparking or burning smells\u2014we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
