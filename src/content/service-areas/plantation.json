    {
      "question": "We have a 5-acre property in Plantation Acres\u2014can you handle the electrical for our entire estate?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Plantation Acres properties are unique in Broward County\u20145-acre estates with multiple structures, guest houses, pool houses, horse barns, and extensive landscape lighting needs. We regularly work on these large properties, designing comprehensive electrical systems that include multiple sub-panels, long-run underground wiring, and proper load balancing across the entire estate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work in the country club communities like Jacaranda or Plantation Isles?",
      "answer": "Yes, we serve all of Plantation's country club and gated communities including Jacaranda Country Club, Plantation Isles, and the various estates off NW 80th Avenue. We understand the HOA coordination often required, the quality expectations in these communities, and the typical electrical challenges of 1980s-1990s construction that's now due for upgrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Plantation home was built in the 1980s\u2014what should I be concerned about?",
      "answer": "1980s Plantation homes often have 150-amp or 200-amp panels that may be approaching end of life, outdated GFCI protection that doesn't meet current codes, and wiring that's now 40+ years old. We recommend an electrical safety inspection to identify any immediate concerns. Common issues we find include corroded breaker connections, deteriorating wire insulation in attics, and panels that are full with no room for additions like EV chargers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add a dedicated circuit for our home office in Plantation?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014dedicated home office circuits are one of our most common requests from Plantation professionals. A dedicated 20-amp circuit prevents your computer from flickering when the AC kicks on, provides stable power for sensitive equipment, and separates your work electronics from household load fluctuations. We typically run a new circuit with multiple outlets exactly where you need them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide commercial electrical near the Westfield Mall area?",
      "answer": "Yes, we service the commercial corridor along University Drive, Broward Boulevard, and the areas surrounding Westfield Broward and Plantation Town Center.
