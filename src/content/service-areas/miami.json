            "question": "Why do Brickell condos have different electrical requirements than single-family homes?",
            "answer": "High-rise condos in Brickell and Edgewater have unique electrical constraints: limited panel space, shared building infrastructure, HOA approval requirements, and strict fire codes. We specialize in Miami condo electrical work—understanding which upgrades are possible, navigating HOA procedures, and maximizing your electrical capacity within building limitations. Many condo owners are surprised to learn they CAN install EV chargers and upgrade panels with proper planning."

        {
            "question": "My Miami home was built in the 1950s—is the wiring still safe?",
            "answer": "Many homes in Coconut Grove, Coral Way, and Shenandoah still have original cloth-insulated wiring and undersized panels. After 60-70 years, this wiring becomes brittle, loses insulation integrity, and can't safely handle modern loads. We've rewired hundreds of Miami's historic homes, preserving architectural character while bringing electrical systems to 2024 code standards. Insurance companies increasingly require updated electrical before issuing policies on older Miami homes."

        {
            "question": "How quickly can you respond to electrical emergencies in Downtown Miami?",
            "answer": "We maintain coverage throughout Miami-Dade to assist with electrical requirements in Downtown Miami, Brickell, and Edgewater. For situation-specific emergencies—such as sparking or burning smells—we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you speak Spanish? Many of my neighbors in Little Havana prefer Spanish.",
            "answer": "¡Sí! Several of our electricians are fluent Spanish speakers. We've proudly served the Little Havana, Westchester, and Hialeah communities for 15+ years. Whether you're more comfortable discussing your electrical needs in Spanish or English, we'll make sure you fully understand the work, service standards, and options before we begin."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's special about electrical work in Miami's coastal neighborhoods?",
            "answer": "Salt air accelerates corrosion on electrical connections, panels, and outdoor fixtures. We see corroded breakers, failed outdoor receptacles, and degraded weatherheads constantly in Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, and bayfront properties. We use marine-grade hardware, corrosion-resistant materials, and proper sealing techniques specifically for Miami's coastal environment. Standard electrical work won't last here."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you help prepare my Miami home for hurricane season?",
            "answer": "Absolutely—hurricane electrical preparedness is one of our specialties. We install transfer switches for generators, whole-home surge protection (critical when power fluctuates during storms), weatherproof outdoor outlets, and ensure your weatherhead and service entrance can withstand high winds. We also inspect panels for water damage after storms. Miami homeowners who prepare before June 1st avoid the rush and have peace of mind all season."
