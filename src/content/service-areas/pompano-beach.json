    {
      "question": "We own a rental property near the Pompano Beach Pier\u2014what electrical issues should we watch for?",
      "answer": "Beachfront Pompano rentals face extreme conditions: constant salt exposure corrodes electrical components faster than anywhere inland. We commonly see rusted weatherheads, failed outdoor GFCIs, corroded panel connections, and degraded exterior lighting. For rental properties, we recommend annual electrical inspections before each season\u2014catching small problems before they cause guest complaints or worse."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you service the industrial warehouses along I-95 and Sample Road?",
      "answer": "Yes, Pompano's industrial corridor is a significant part of our commercial work. We handle 3-phase power installations, warehouse LED lighting retrofits, loading dock electrical, manufacturing equipment wiring, and emergency repairs that keep operations running. We understand that every hour of downtime costs money."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is downtown Pompano Beach going through renovation\u2014how does that affect electrical work?",
      "answer": "The downtown Pompano area is being revitalized with new development near the pier and along Atlantic Boulevard. Many older buildings being renovated need complete electrical overhauls to meet modern codes. We're experienced with renovation electrical\u2014upgrading from outdated systems to modern panels, adding the circuits commercial tenants need, and working efficiently within construction timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Pompano home was built in the 1960s near the Intracoastal\u2014should we rewire?",
      "answer": "Many original Pompano homes east of Federal Highway have 50-60 year old wiring that wasn't designed for today's loads. Combined with decades of salt air exposure, these systems often have deteriorated connections, undersized panels, and outdated safety features. A full rewire may not always be necessary\u2014sometimes targeted upgrades address the most pressing issues. We provide honest assessments of what you actually need."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install dock lighting and power at our Pompano Intracoastal home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Waterfront electrical on the Intracoastal requires specialized knowledge\u2014NEC Article 555 for marina safety, proper GFCI protection, corrosion-resistant fixtures, and underground or underwater-rated cable where needed. We install dock pedestals, boat lift power, seawall lighting, and shoreline illumination throughout Pompano's waterfront neighborhoods."

    {
      "question": "How fast can you respond to emergencies in Pompano Beach?",
      "answer": "Pompano Beach is in the heart of our Broward service area.  For after-hours emergencies\u2014sparking, burning smells, or complete outages\u2014we allocate resources. We serve all of Pompano from Cypress Lakes to Hillsboro Shores."
