    {
      "question": "Our Lake Ida home is historic\u2014can you modernize the electrical sensitively?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Lake Ida's historic homes require electricians who understand how to add modern capacity while respecting architectural character. We can update panels, add grounded circuits, and install modern lighting without visible conduit runs or damage to historic features. We've worked on many downtown Delray historic properties and understand the aesthetic considerations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's different about electrical work in Delray's beach homes?",
      "answer": "Properties east of the Intracoastal face constant salt exposure that accelerates corrosion on electrical components. We use marine-grade enclosures, stainless hardware, and sealed connections for all beachfront work. Outdoor outlets, lighting fixtures, and panel enclosures all need upgraded materials to last in the coastal environment."
