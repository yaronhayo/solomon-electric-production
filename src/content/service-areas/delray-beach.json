    {
      "question": "Do you work with restaurants and businesses on Atlantic Avenue?",
      "answer": "Yes, Atlantic Avenue's dining and entertainment district is a key part of our commercial work in Delray Beach. We understand the specific needs: kitchen electrical for restaurants, high-capacity circuits for commercial equipment, outdoor patio lighting and power, signage circuits, and the urgency of emergency repairs when every hour of downtime costs money. We work efficiently and around your business schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Lake Ida home is historic—can you modernize the electrical sensitively?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Lake Ida's historic homes require electricians who understand how to add modern capacity while respecting architectural character. We can update panels, add grounded circuits, and install modern lighting without visible conduit runs or damage to historic features. We've worked on many downtown Delray historic properties and understand the aesthetic considerations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's different about electrical work in Delray's beach homes?",
      "answer": "Properties east of the Intracoastal face constant salt exposure that accelerates corrosion on electrical components. We use marine-grade enclosures, stainless hardware, and sealed connections for all beachfront work. Outdoor outlets, lighting fixtures, and panel enclosures all need upgraded materials to last in the coastal environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you serve artists and galleries in Pineapple Grove?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide electrical services for the creative businesses in Pineapple Grove Arts District. Gallery lighting, studio circuits for equipment, and the specialized needs of creative spaces are all within our expertise. We understand that lighting design is critical for showcasing art properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there anything unique about permitting in Delray Beach?",
      "answer": "Delray Beach is part of Palm Beach County's permitting jurisdiction, with additional requirements for work in the historic district. We handle all permitting and ensure work meets both county codes and any additional local requirements. Understanding the specific rules is part of our job."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Delray Beach?",
      "answer": "We provide emergency electrical service throughout Delray Beach and the surrounding Palm Beach County area. Our technicians are positioned across South Florida to respond to critical situations including power failures, burning smells, and sparking outlets. Call us anytime—we're available 24/7, including weekends and holidays."
