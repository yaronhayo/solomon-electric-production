    {
      "question": "My Hollywood home was built in the 1970s\u2014what electrical issues should I expect?",
      "answer": "Hollywood saw major residential growth in the 1970s-80s, and those homes are now 40-50 years old with electrical systems that weren't designed for today's demands. Common issues include undersized 100-amp panels, aluminum wiring (a fire risk), outdated breakers, and insufficient outlets. We've modernized hundreds of Hollywood Hills and Emerald Hills homes from this era\u2014it's one of our most common projects in the area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you service the beach condos along A1A in Hollywood?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We're familiar with the high-rise and mid-rise buildings along Hollywood Beach and the Broadwalk. Condo electrical work requires working with building management, understanding shared electrical infrastructure, and often navigating HOA approval processes. Whether you need a panel upgrade, EV charger installation, or lighting refresh, we handle the coordination so you don't have to."
    },
    {
      "question": "We're opening a business near Young Circle\u2014can you handle commercial electrical?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services throughout Downtown Hollywood and the Arts District near Young Circle. Whether you're opening a restaurant, retail shop, or office, we handle commercial lighting installations, 3-phase power, signage circuits, POS system wiring, and code compliance inspections. Hollywood's revitalized downtown is growing\u2014we've helped numerous businesses get powered up and open."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Hollywood's coastal location affect my electrical system?",
      "answer": "Properties in Hollywood Beach and Hollywood Lakes experience accelerated corrosion from salt air. We commonly see rusted weatherheads, corroded panel connections, and failed outdoor outlets\u2014often years before they'd fail in inland areas. For coastal Hollywood properties, we specify corrosion-resistant materials and marine-grade hardware to extend the life of your electrical installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install outdoor lighting along the Intracoastal in Hollywood?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014waterfront lighting is a specialty for us. For Hollywood properties along the Intracoastal, we install dock lighting, seawall accent lighting, and landscape illumination that withstands the marine environment. Proper wire gauge, sealed connections, and GFCI protection are critical near water. We also ensure lighting doesn't create navigation hazards for boaters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer generator installation for Hollywood homes?",
      "answer": "Yes, and Hollywood homes particularly benefit from generator protection. Between hurricane vulnerability and the aging FPL infrastructure in some neighborhoods, power outages happen more frequently here than you might expect. We install both portable generator transfer switches and whole-home standby generators\u2014the latter providing automatic power restoration within seconds of an outage."
