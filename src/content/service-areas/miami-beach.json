  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do electrical systems in Miami Beach fail faster than on the mainland?",
      "answer": "Miami Beach is literally surrounded by salt water on all sides. Salt spray accelerates corrosion of every exposed metal surface—weatherheads, panel enclosures, exterior outlets, junction boxes. We see Miami Beach electrical components fail in 5-7 years that would last 15-20 years in inland Broward. For Miami Beach properties, we exclusively use marine-grade stainless steel hardware, corrosion-resistant enclosures, and sealed connections designed for constant salt exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "We're renovating an Art Deco building in South Beach—can you update the electrical while preserving the historic character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We've completed electrical upgrades in numerous buildings within the Miami Beach Architectural Historic District. The challenge is installing modern wiring and panels without visible impact to historic elements—no surface-mounted conduit, no inappropriate covers, hidden panel locations. We work with historic preservation requirements and understand what inspectors in the district expect. The result is a fully modern, code-compliant electrical system that's invisible within your Art Deco masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is electrical flooding damage a concern for Miami Beach properties?",
      "answer": "Yes—Miami Beach experiences tidal flooding even without storms. If your panel or electrical equipment is in a garage or ground-floor utility room, it may have been exposed to salt water at some point. After flooding events, we recommend an electrical inspection to check for corroded breakers, damaged connections, and compromised grounding. Saltwater damage is often invisible initially but causes failures months or years later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you service the private islands—Star Island, Fisher Island, Venetian Islands?",
      "answer": "Yes, we regularly work on Star Island, the Venetian Islands, Sunset Islands, La Gorce Island, and in Fisher Island (ferry access). These properties have unique requirements: massive power capacity (often 400-800 amp service), sophisticated landscape lighting, marine dock power, and whole-estate automation. We understand the level of quality expected and the logistics of working on access-controlled islands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install an EV charger in my Mid-Beach condo building?",
      "answer": "We specialize in Miami Beach condo EV installations. The challenges include limited parking space electrical infrastructure, building management approval, load capacity concerns, and Florida's condo EV rights law (Statute 718.113). We've successfully installed chargers in buildings that initially seemed impossible—the key is proper load assessment and creative solutions. We handle all coordination with your building management and HOA."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies on Miami Beach?",
      "answer": "We maintain coverage in Miami Beach to assist with coastal electrical requirements. For situation-specific emergencies—such as active sparking or complete outages—we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
