  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do you work in the Inverrary condos and townhomes?",
      "answer": "Yes, Inverrary is one of our most-served communities in Lauderhill. We understand the condo association coordination, the specific electrical systems in Inverrary units, and the common issues in 1970s-80s construction—overloaded panels, outdated GFCIs, and aging wiring. We work efficiently within association guidelines and treat your home with respect."
    },
    {
      "question": "We moved from Jamaica—do you have electricians who speak patois or understand Caribbean electrical terminology?",
      "answer": "Lauderhill has a vibrant Caribbean community, and we're proud to serve neighbors from Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, and throughout the islands. We communicate clearly about all work and service standards, explain everything thoroughly, and make sure you understand exactly what you're getting. Your comfort and trust matter to us."
    },
    {
      "question": "My 1970s Lauderhill home has a Zinsco panel—is that a problem?",
      "answer": "Yes—Zinsco panels, like Federal Pacific panels, have a documented history of breaker failure. Breakers that don't trip during overloads allow wires to overheat, creating fire risk. If you have a Zinsco panel (common in 1970s-80s Lauderhill construction), we recommend replacement. Many insurance companies now require it. We provide honest assessments and professional service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add more outlets in an older Lauderhill home?",
      "answer": "Definitely. 1970s-80s homes were built with far fewer outlets than families need today. Adding outlets is straightforward and much safer than using extension cords and power strips, which are fire hazards. We can add outlets throughout your home, including dedicated circuits for high-draw items like window AC units or space heaters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide commercial electrical near Oakland Park Boulevard?",
      "answer": "Yes, we service the commercial corridors along Oakland Park Boulevard, Commercial Boulevard, and University Drive in Lauderhill. Services include tenant buildouts, retail lighting upgrades, restaurant electrical, and 24/7 emergency response for businesses that can't afford extended downtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Lauderhill?",
      "answer": "Lauderhill is centrally located in our Broward service area with excellent access via the Turnpike, Oakland Park Boulevard, and University Drive.  For after-hours emergencies—sparking, burning smells, or complete outages—we allocate resources."
