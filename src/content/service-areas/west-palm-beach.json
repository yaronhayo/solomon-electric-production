    {
      "question": "We bought a historic home in El Cid\u2014what electrical challenges should we expect?",
      "answer": "El Cid and Flamingo Park have some of Palm Beach County's most beautiful historic homes, but many still have original 1920s-1940s electrical systems. Common issues include knob-and-tube wiring, 60-amp fuse boxes, insufficient outlets, and ungrounded systems. The challenge is modernizing these homes to handle AC, modern kitchens, and home offices while preserving their architectural character. We've completed dozens of historic West Palm rewiring projects\u2014it's one of our specialties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is working with Palm Beach County permits different from South Miami-Dade or Broward?",
      "answer": "Each Florida county has different permit processes, inspection schedules, and fee structures. Palm Beach County tends to be more thorough in inspections and has specific requirements that differ from Miami-Dade and Broward. We're experienced with Palm Beach County building department procedures and handle all permitting for West Palm Beach projects. Our 100% inspection pass rate means your project won't face delays."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install landscape lighting for our Intracoastal property in West Palm?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Waterfront properties in West Palm Beach\u2014along Flagler Drive, the El Cid waterfront, and throughout the Intracoastal neighborhoods\u2014benefit tremendously from professional landscape lighting. We design and install systems that highlight your property's best features, enhance security, and withstand the coastal environment. Low-voltage LED systems keep operating costs minimal while providing stunning nighttime aesthetics."

    {
      "question": "We're opening a business near The Square (CityPlace)\u2014do you handle commercial electrical?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services throughout downtown West Palm Beach. Whether you're doing a tenant buildout, installing specialty lighting for a restaurant, adding circuits for new equipment, or need ongoing maintenance, we handle commercial projects from small retail to multi-story office buildings. We understand that construction timelines are tight and coordinate efficiently with general contractors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our West Palm home is all-electric with no gas\u2014is a generator worth it?",
      "answer": "For all-electric homes, a standby generator is particularly valuable because you have no backup cooking, water heating, or HVAC options during outages. West Palm Beach experiences power outages from hurricanes, summer storms, and occasional infrastructure issues. A properly sized generator keeps your entire home running automatically. For all-electric homes, we typically recommend generators that can power the full house including AC\u2014not just essential circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in West Palm Beach?",
      "answer": "We maintain Palm Beach County coverage to serve West Palm Beach and surrounding areas. For situation-specific emergencies\u2014such as sparking or complete power loss\u2014we prioritize the allocation of technical resources."
