            "question": "We live in Keystone Islands—do you understand waterfront electrical challenges?",
            "answer": "Yes, Keystone Islands and the other waterfront areas of North Miami require specialized electrical knowledge. Salt air corrodes standard components faster, dock and seawall electrical must meet NEC Article 555 marina standards, and outdoor fixtures need marine-grade ratings. We use corrosion-resistant enclosures, stainless hardware, and sealed connections that withstand the bay environment."
        },
        {
            "question": "Our North Miami home is on a flood-prone street—should we be concerned about our electrical panel?",
            "answer": "Yes—if your panel is in a garage, utility room, or anywhere that could flood, you're at risk. After flooding, salt water damages breakers, wiring connections, and grounding systems in ways that aren't immediately visible. We recommend elevating panels above flood levels when possible, and if your home has ever flooded, scheduling an inspection to check for hidden damage that could cause failures months later."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you serve businesses near FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus?",
            "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services throughout North Miami, including the areas near FIU Biscayne Bay, the NE 125th Street corridor, and downtown North Miami. Services include tenant buildouts, restaurant electrical, retail lighting upgrades, and 24/7 emergency response for businesses that can't afford extended outages."
        },
        {
            "question": "My North Miami home was built in the 1950s—is rewiring necessary?",
            "answer": "Not always, but homes from the 1950s often have original fabric-insulated wiring, undersized panels, and two-prong ungrounded outlets. A complete rewire may not be necessary if the wiring is still in good condition—sometimes targeted upgrades (panel replacement, GFCI addition, adding grounded circuits where needed) address the main concerns. We provide honest assessments of what you actually need."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you install outdoor lighting along our North Miami bayfront?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Waterfront landscape lighting enhances security and views while increasing property value. For bayfront properties, we use marine-grade fixtures designed for salt exposure and ensure all connections are properly sealed and GFCI protected. Low-voltage LED systems are ideal—they're energy efficient, safer near water, and provide beautiful nighttime illumination."
        },
        {
            "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in North Miami?",
            "answer": "North Miami is in the heart of our Miami-Dade service area.  For after-hours emergencies—sparking, burning smells, or complete power loss—we allocate resources. We serve all North Miami neighborhoods from Arch Creek to Keystone Islands."
