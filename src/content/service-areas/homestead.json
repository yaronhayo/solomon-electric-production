    {
      "question": "We have a nursery in the Redland area\u2014can you handle agricultural electrical?",
      "answer": "Yes, Homestead's agricultural sector is part of our specialty work. We install and maintain electrical for nurseries, shade houses, irrigation pump systems, packing facilities, and farm equipment. The Redland area has unique requirements\u2014including often needing 3-phase power for larger operations\u2014and we understand the specific needs of agricultural properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Homestead gets hit hard by hurricanes\u2014should we install a generator?",
      "answer": "Homestead is often the first landfall point for storms approaching South Florida, and you're far from the priority areas for power restoration. A whole-home standby generator isn't a luxury here\u2014it's nearly essential. We size generators to handle your AC, refrigeration, well pump if applicable, and essential circuits. Many Homestead families have learned the hard way that portable generators aren't enough."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Waterstone home is new\u2014do we still need electrical services?",
      "answer": "New construction electrical is typically fine, but Waterstone and other recent developments often need additions: EV charger installations, home office circuits, landscape lighting, or surge protection that builders don't include. We also see builder-grade fixtures that homeowners want upgraded, and additions like ceiling fans or extra outlets in the garage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in South Dade?",
      "answer": "For situation-specific emergencies\u2014such as sparking or burning smells\u2014we prioritize the allocation of technical resources based on the safety requirements of the property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install electrical for an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) or guest house on our Homestead property?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Homestead properties have space for ADUs, guest houses, or mother-in-law suites that need separate electrical service or sub-panels. We handle the design, Miami-Dade County permitting, and installation for accessory structures, ensuring proper load calculation and code compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our older Homestead home is on well water\u2014what electrical considerations matter?",
      "answer": "Well pumps need reliable power\u2014when electricity goes out, so does your water. We recommend generator backup for well properties, properly sized circuits for your pump, and surge protection to prevent pump motor damage from voltage spikes. We also ensure proper grounding for well components, which is critical for safety."
