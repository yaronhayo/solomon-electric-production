    {
      "question": "Weston homes are relatively new\u2014why would we need electrical upgrades?",
      "answer": "While Weston is newer than most South Florida cities, many homes here are now 20-30 years old with electrical systems designed for 1990s-2000s technology. Today's smart homes, EV chargers, multiple AC zones, and home offices demand more than original installations provided. We see many Weston homes running at or near capacity. Additionally, some early Weston developments used builder-grade components that are now showing their age."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work on the large estate properties in Windmill Ranch and Saddle Club?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Windmill Ranch Estates and Saddle Club Estates have some of the largest residential properties in South Florida\u2014homes that often require 400-amp service, multiple sub-panels, extensive landscape lighting systems, pool/spa equipment, and whole-home generators. We have extensive experience with estate-scale electrical systems and understand the expectations for quality and reliability in these communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Weston home loses power during summer storms\u2014what can we do?",
      "answer": "Western Broward is one of the most lightning-prone areas in America, and the power infrastructure serving Weston is vulnerable to storm damage. Two solutions: whole-home surge protection (critical to protect electronics from voltage spikes when power fluctuates) and standby generator installation (automatic power restoration within seconds of an outage). Many Weston families consider both essential\u2014especially those working from home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install charging for two EVs at our Weston home?",
      "answer": "Yes\u2014dual EV household setups are becoming common in Weston. The key is ensuring your panel has capacity for both chargers (typically 80-100 amps total) or implementing load-sharing solutions. Many Weston homes built with 200-amp service can accommodate dual EVs. Larger homes with 400-amp service have plenty of capacity. We assess your specific situation and recommend the most practical approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do your electricians speak Spanish? Many Weston residents prefer it.",
      "answer": "S\u00ed, varios de nuestros electricistas hablan espa\u00f1ol con fluidez. Weston has a large Venezuelan and Latin American community, and we're happy to conduct consultations, explain work, and provide documentation in Spanish. Clear communication is important\u2014especially for complex electrical projects\u2014and we want you fully informed in whichever language you prefer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in western Weston near I-75?",
      "answer": "We maintain electricians in western Broward specifically because Weston, Pembroke Pines, and Miramar are significant parts of our service area.   The I-595 and I-75 corridors give us direct access to all Weston neighborhoods."
