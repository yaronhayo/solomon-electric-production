We also see builder-grade fixtures that homeowners want to upgrade and the addition of ceiling fans and home office circuits."

      "question": "Is Palm Beach County permitting different from Broward?",

    {
      "question": "Our Valencia Reserve home is all-electric with no gas\u2014should we have a generator?",
      "answer": "For all-electric homes in Boynton Beach, generators become even more important\u2014when power goes out, you lose not just AC but also your cooktop, water heating, and everything else.
