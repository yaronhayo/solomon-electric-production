    {
      "question": "Can you install dock power at our Boynton Beach Intracoastal home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Boynton's waterfront properties near the inlet and along the Intracoastal need specialized dock electrical that meets NEC Article 555 marina safety requirements. We install dock pedestals with properly rated circuits, boat lift power, shore power connections, and seawall lighting—all using marine-grade corrosion-resistant components."
    },
    {
      "question": "We live in Aberdeen—what electrical issues are common in our community?",
      "answer": "Aberdeen homes are typically well-maintained, but many are now 15-20+ years old. Common requests include panel upgrades to support EV chargers and home additions, landscape lighting installations, and whole-home surge protection. We also see builder-grade fixtures that homeowners want to upgrade and the addition of ceiling fans and home office circuits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Palm Beach County permitting different from Broward?",
      "answer": "Yes, Palm Beach County has its own permitting process and code requirements that differ from Broward and Miami-Dade. We're licensed to work in all three counties and handle all permitting for Boynton Beach projects. Understanding the specific requirements of each jurisdiction is part of our job—you don't need to worry about it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you service the commercial district near Congress Avenue?",
      "answer": "Yes, we provide commercial electrical services along Congress Avenue, Boynton Beach Boulevard, and the surrounding business areas. Services include tenant buildouts, retail and restaurant electrical, parking lot lighting, and 24/7 emergency response for businesses that can't afford extended outages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Our Valencia Reserve home is all-electric with no gas—should we have a generator?",
      "answer": "For all-electric homes in Boynton Beach, generators become even more important—when power goes out, you lose not just AC but also your cooktop, water heating, and everything else. We size generators to handle the full electrical load or prioritize critical circuits based on your preferences and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Boynton Beach?",
      "answer": "We provide electrical services to the Boynton Beach area as part of our regional coverage. For urgent requirements, we allocate technical resources based on the specific safety needs of the property."
